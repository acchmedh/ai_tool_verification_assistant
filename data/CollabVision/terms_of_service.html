<p>Our total aggregate liability under or in connection with this Agreement or your use of the Platform shall not exceed the amount paid by your organization for the platform services during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to such liability. This liability cap reflects the allocation of risks between the parties and is a fundamental part of the bargain for your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>We shall not be responsible for any damages caused by delays, errors, or interruptions in the operation of the Platform resulting from circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, acts of government, war, terrorism, strikes, or failures of telecommunications networks or internet service providers. Users acknowledge that the Platform is provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and that we do not guarantee continuous, secure, or error-free operation.</p>
<p>By accepting this Agreement, you agree that these limitations of liability are fair and reasonable, and that they form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties. If any provision of this section is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>Termination and Suspension</h2>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing written notice to the other party, subject to the terms specified herein. The organization may terminate its subscription by following the procedures outlined in the applicable cancellation policy, which generally requires providing at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice. Upon termination, all rights granted to the organization under this Agreement shall immediately cease, and the organization shall promptly cease all use of the Platform.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the Platform immediately and without prior notice if we determine, in our sole discretion, that the organization or any User has materially violated any terms of this Agreement, engaged in unlawful activities, or threatened the security or integrity of the Platform. Such suspension or termination shall be effective upon notice to the organization, and we shall have no liability for any damages resulting from such actions.</p>
<p>Upon termination, any Data or Content stored within the Platform shall be retained for a period of thirty (30) days unless otherwise required by law. After this period, we reserve the right to delete all Data and Content associated with the terminated account without further notice. The organization shall remain responsible for any outstanding fees or charges accrued prior to termination. Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any provisions which, by their nature, are intended to survive, including confidentiality, intellectual property rights, and limitations of liability.</p>

<h3>Termination by User</h3>
<p>Users may terminate their individual access to the Platform at any time by providing written notice to their organization’s designated Administrator or through the designated account management interface, if available. Such termination shall become effective immediately upon receipt of notice or as specified in the notice, and the User shall cease all use of the Platform thereafter. Users are responsible for ensuring that all Content, Data, or other materials they wish to retain are downloaded or otherwise preserved prior to termination, as the Platform may delete or disable access to such information following termination.</p>
<p>It is important to note that termination of a User account does not automatically terminate the organization’s Subscription or other contractual obligations unless explicitly stated in the applicable agreement. The organization remains responsible for any outstanding fees or charges incurred prior to the effective date of termination. Additionally, the organization may choose to deactivate or remove individual Users within their account management system, subject to their internal policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Upon termination, the User’s access rights shall be revoked, and the User shall no longer be permitted to access or use the Platform. We shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from the termination of a User’s access, including the loss of Data or Content. Users are encouraged to ensure that all relevant Data is backed up or transferred prior to termination to prevent any potential loss of information. Users may also request the organization to delete their Data from the Platform, subject to the organization’s data retention policies and applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>In cases where a User terminates their access due to concerns over security or privacy, they should notify their organization and us promptly to facilitate appropriate action. The termination process is designed to respect the rights of individual Users while maintaining the integrity of the organization’s use of the Platform and compliance with this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Suspension by Provider</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or temporarily disable access to the Platform immediately and without prior notice if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such action is necessary to protect the security, integrity, or proper functioning of the Platform, or to prevent any violation of this Agreement or applicable law. Grounds for suspension include, but are not limited to, suspected unauthorized access, malicious activity, breach of confidentiality, or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
<p>In the event of a suspension, we shall, where feasible, notify the organization or affected Users promptly, unless such notification would compromise the purpose of the suspension or violate legal obligations. During the suspension period, the organization’s access to the Platform shall be limited or entirely revoked, and all associated Data or Content may become temporarily inaccessible.</p>
<p>We shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or disruptions resulting from such suspension, including but not limited to loss of Data, interruption of business operations, or reputational harm. The organization shall remain responsible for any obligations incurred prior to the suspension, including payment of fees or charges. Additionally, we reserve the right to extend, renew, or reinstate access at our sole discretion, subject to the resolution of the underlying issues that prompted the suspension.</p>
<p>Any suspension shall be deemed temporary unless explicitly stated otherwise, and we shall undertake reasonable efforts to restore access as soon as the issues are resolved. If suspension persists beyond a reasonable period or if we determine that continued access poses a material risk, we may terminate this Agreement and pursue further legal remedies as deemed appropriate. The organization acknowledges that suspension is an interim measure and does not constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies available under this Agreement or applicable law.</p>

Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses associated with the arbitration, except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator. This governing law and dispute resolution clause is intended to provide a fair, efficient, and binding mechanism for resolving conflicts related to this Agreement, and supersedes any conflicting provisions that may be contained in other documents or policies.</p>

This arbitration clause shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and shall be the exclusive remedy for resolving disputes related thereto, thereby superseding any other legal or procedural avenues, including litigation, unless otherwise mandated by applicable law.</p>
