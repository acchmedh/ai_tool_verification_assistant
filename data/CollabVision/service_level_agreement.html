<p>Any modifications or amendments to this Agreement shall be made in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both parties to be considered valid and enforceable. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, changes in scope of services, performance standards, or support obligations. The Service Provider reserves the right to propose updates to this SLA periodically to accommodate technological advancements, changes in applicable laws, or evolving industry standards. In such cases, the Service Provider shall provide the Client with written notice of the proposed amendments at least thirty (30) days prior to their effective date.</p>
<p>The Client shall review and acknowledge any proposed changes within the notice period. If the Client does not object in writing within this timeframe, the modifications shall be deemed accepted and incorporated into this Agreement. Should the Client object to any material modification, both parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the concerns or, if necessary, may agree to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the termination provisions herein. No amendments shall be valid or binding unless executed in writing and signed by authorized personnel of both parties.</p>
<p>This process ensures that all modifications are transparent, consensual, and documented, thereby preserving the integrity of the contractual relationship. It also provides a clear framework for adapting the Agreement to changing circumstances while maintaining mutual accountability and legal clarity. Both parties acknowledge that failure to adhere to this modification procedure may result in disputes or unenforceable amendments, which could compromise the effectiveness of this SLA and the delivery of the services herein described.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>This section delineates the specific circumstances under which either party may terminate this Agreement prior to its scheduled expiration date. Termination shall be permissible only if the conditions outlined herein are met and properly documented in writing, in accordance with the procedures specified in this SLA. The Service Provider may terminate this Agreement immediately if the Client breaches material terms, including but not limited to non-payment of fees, unauthorized use of the platform, or violation of confidentiality obligations, and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice. Conversely, the Client may terminate for cause if the Service Provider materially breaches its obligations and such breach remains uncured after the same cure period.</p>
<p>In addition to breach-related termination, either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon providing sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the other party, subject to the settlement of all outstanding fees and obligations. Termination due to force majeure, governmental actions, or other events beyond the reasonable control of either party shall be effective immediately if such events substantially impair the ability to perform under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Upon termination, the Client shall immediately cease all use of the Service and shall return or destroy all confidential information and data in accordance with the provisions of this SLA. The Service Provider shall provide a final statement of account, including any applicable final fees or refunds, and shall cooperate to facilitate an orderly disengagement. Termination shall not affect accrued rights or obligations, including confidentiality and liability limitations, which shall survive such event. Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to minimize disruption and ensure compliance with all termination procedures outlined herein.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This Section constitutes miscellaneous provisions that are integral to the enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement. Neither party shall be deemed to have waived any rights or obligations under this SLA unless such waiver is explicitly made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. Any failure or delay in exercising a right shall not be construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall it constitute a waiver of any other rights or remedies.</p>
<p>Confidentiality obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement. Each party agrees to safeguard the Confidential Information of the other and shall not disclose, reproduce, or use such information except as expressly permitted herein or as required by law. The obligations of confidentiality shall remain in effect for a period of five (5) years following the termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>In the event any provision of this SLA is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, or representations, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards in the performance of their respective obligations. Any notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered via certified mail, email, or other mutually agreed methods to the addresses specified in the Service Agreement.</p>
<p>Finally, this SLA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the governing law clause of the main contract. Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within such jurisdiction. This section ensures that all miscellaneous provisions are addressed to promote clarity, enforceability, and mutual understanding between the parties.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the main contractual document between the parties, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Both parties agree that any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this SLA, including its formation, interpretation, performance, or termination, shall be resolved exclusively within the courts located within such jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The parties acknowledge and agree that this choice of law and jurisdiction is a material inducement for entering into this Agreement and reflects their mutual intent to ensure a clear and predictable legal framework for all contractual matters. In the event of any conflict between the laws of the chosen jurisdiction and any other applicable laws, the provisions of the chosen jurisdiction shall prevail to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider reserves the right to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in any competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights, confidential information, or to prevent breaches of confidentiality obligations. Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to resolve disputes amicably prior to initiating legal proceedings. This Governing Law clause shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and continue to bind the parties for any disputes arising therefrom.</p>

<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this SLA, including its formation, interpretation, performance, or termination, the parties shall first seek to resolve the matter amicably through good-faith negotiations. Such negotiations shall be initiated within thirty (30) days of either party’s receipt of written notice of the dispute, with the aim of reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution without resorting to formal proceedings.</p>
<p>If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within a further thirty (30) days, the parties agree to submit the matter to mediation administered by a mutually agreed-upon neutral mediator, or if such agreement cannot be reached, by an established arbitration organization. The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the selected organization, and each party shall bear its own costs associated therewith. The goal of mediation is to facilitate a resolution without the need for arbitration or litigation.</p>
<p>If mediation fails to resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days, or if either party refuses to participate in mediation, the dispute shall then be submitted to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by mutual agreement of the parties, or, in the absence of such agreement, in accordance with the rules of the jurisdiction’s recognized arbitration authority. The arbitration proceedings shall be held in the jurisdiction specified in the Governing Law section, and the arbitration award shall be final and binding on both parties. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the dispute resolution process, including legal fees, unless the arbitration award specifies otherwise. This dispute resolution process is intended to provide a fair, efficient, and conclusive mechanism for resolving disagreements and shall be a condition precedent to any legal proceedings, except where injunctive relief or other equitable remedies are sought to protect intellectual property rights or confidential information.</p>
