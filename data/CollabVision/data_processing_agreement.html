<p>The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date specified herein and shall continue in effect for an initial period of twelve (12) months, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. Upon the expiration of the initial term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. Such renewal shall be contingent upon the continued compliance by both parties with all applicable legal and contractual obligations pertaining to data processing and security.</p>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for convenience by providing written notice to the other party no less than thirty (30) days prior to the intended termination date. Termination for cause may be effected immediately if either party breaches material obligations under this Agreement and such breach remains unremedied for a period of fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice specifying the breach. In the event of termination, the Data Processor shall, in accordance with the Data Controller’s instructions, securely delete or return all Personal Data processed under this Agreement, unless retention is mandated by applicable law.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any termination, the obligations concerning confidentiality, data security, and the handling of Personal Data shall survive for a period of five (5) years from the date of termination or until such data is fully deleted or anonymized, as applicable. Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to ensure a seamless transition and to fulfill all outstanding responsibilities related to data processing and compliance during and after the termination process.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>The termination of this Agreement shall be subject to the conditions outlined herein and shall only be effected in accordance with the procedures specified. Either party may initiate termination if the other party materially breaches any obligation under this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice specifying the nature of the breach. Additionally, termination may occur if either party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or is subject to any legal or regulatory action that materially affects its ability to fulfill its contractual obligations.</p>
<p>Prior to termination, the terminating party shall provide written notice to the other party, specifying the effective date of termination, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date of such notice unless immediate termination is justified due to material breach or legal necessity. In such cases, the notice period may be waived or shortened as appropriate. Upon termination, the Data Processor shall, in accordance with the Data Controller’s instructions, securely delete or return all Personal Data processed under this Agreement, ensuring that all copies are destroyed or anonymized to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Termination shall not relieve either party from obligations that have accrued prior to the effective date, including confidentiality, data security, and breach notification requirements. All rights and licenses granted herein shall cease upon termination, except as otherwise expressly provided. The Data Processor shall cooperate with the Data Controller to ensure a seamless transition, including providing assistance in the transfer of Personal Data or confirming its secure deletion, as instructed. Any outstanding fees or obligations shall remain payable, and the terms governing confidentiality and data protection shall survive termination.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where the Data Controller is established, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Both parties agree that any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to its formation, validity, interpretation, performance, or termination, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within such jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In the event of a dispute, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the matter amicably through good-faith negotiations. Should such negotiations fail within thirty (30) days, either party may submit the dispute to the competent courts as specified herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Data Controller reserves the right to seek injunctive relief or other urgent remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its rights and interests related to data security, confidentiality, or compliance obligations.</p>
<p>This choice of law and jurisdiction clause is intended to ensure clarity and predictability in the resolution of legal disputes, and both parties acknowledge that it is a fundamental part of this Agreement. The parties agree to cooperate fully and to abide by the final decisions of the competent courts. Nothing in this clause shall limit or exclude the rights of either party to seek interim or provisional measures in any appropriate jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm pending the resolution of disputes.</p>
