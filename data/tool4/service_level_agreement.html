<p>This Service Level Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions under which Tool_4 ("Service
    Provider") will deliver its AI Analytics services to the Customer ("Client") utilizing advanced AI-driven analytics
    tailored for enterprise IT environments. Tool_4 is designed to empower organizations by providing actionable
    insights derived from complex data sets, enabling optimized resource allocation and enhanced decision-making through
    predictive modeling and intelligent reporting.</p>
<p>By entering into this Agreement, the User acknowledges and agrees to the responsibilities and service levels
    described herein, which are intended to ensure the highest quality of service delivery. The Service Provider commits
    to maintaining the availability, performance, and support standards as defined in this document. However, the
    specific metrics and remedies for any deviations will be detailed in subsequent sections.</p>
<p>It is understood that the Agreement applies exclusively to the Customer's enterprise IT environment and the data
    processed therein. While the Service Provider aims to guarantee continuous service availability, certain scheduled
    maintenance windows and unforeseen interruptions may occur. The duration of such interruptions will not exceed a
    reasonable period, which is subject to interpretation based on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Throughout this Agreement, references to "User" and "Customer" may be used interchangeably to denote the party
    receiving services, unless otherwise specified. Both terms shall be construed as referring to the same entity for
    the purposes of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The purpose of this Agreement is to establish a mutual understanding between the Service Provider and the Client
    regarding the delivery, management, and support of the Tool_4 AI Analytics services. This Agreement defines the
    scope of services, performance standards, and the responsibilities of both parties to ensure that the Client
    receives reliable and effective analytics solutions tailored to their enterprise IT environment.</p>
<p>Through this Agreement, the Service Provider commits to providing the Client with continuous access to the Tool_4
    platform, including predictive modeling, intelligent reporting, and data insight capabilities. The Client, in turn,
    agrees to utilize the Service in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein and to provide accurate
    information necessary for the Service Provider to deliver optimal results.</p>
<p>This Agreement also outlines the expected service levels and availability targets, although specific uptime
    guarantees may fluctuate based on factors beyond the Service Provider's control, such as network outages or
    third-party system failures. Furthermore, while the Service Provider strives to maintain data integrity and
    security, it cannot be held liable for unauthorized access resulting from the Client's failure to implement
    recommended security measures.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the term "User" as used in this Agreement may sometimes refer to individual personnel within
    the Client's organization, whereas "Customer" denotes the corporate entity itself. This distinction is important
    when interpreting responsibilities related to data access and service usage. Additionally, the Agreement anticipates
    that service interruptions, whether scheduled or unscheduled, will be resolved within a reasonable timeframe;
    however, this timeframe is not explicitly defined and may vary depending on the nature of the issue.</p>

<h3>Scope of Services</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall deliver the Tool_4 AI Analytics services in accordance with the specifications outlined in
    this Agreement. The scope encompasses data ingestion, processing, predictive analytics, and reporting
    functionalities specifically designed to operate within the Client's enterprise IT infrastructure. Services include
    but are not limited to automated data aggregation, anomaly detection, resource usage forecasting, and customizable
    dashboard generation.</p>
<p>The Service Provider agrees to maintain the availability of the Tool_4 platform during standard business hours,
    defined as 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM local time, Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays observed by the Client’s
    primary location. Outside of these hours, access to certain features may be subject to limitations or temporary
    suspension due to maintenance or upgrades. Notwithstanding this, the Client shall have 24/7 access to core reporting
    functionalities, except during emergency maintenance events, which may occur without prior notice.</p>
<p>Data retention and handling are integral to the Service; the Service Provider will retain the Client's analytics data
    for a minimum of six months following termination of services. However, the Service Provider also reserves the right
    to retain anonymized data indefinitely for the purpose of service improvement and benchmarking, which may conflict
    with certain data deletion requests made by the Customer.</p>
<p>It is understood that while the Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure data accuracy
    and system reliability, the Service Provider does not warrant that the analytics outputs will be error-free or that
    all insights generated will be actionable. Additionally, the terms “User” and “Client” may be used interchangeably
    within this section, potentially causing ambiguity regarding responsibilities related to data input and system
    access.</p>

<h3>Definitions and Terminology</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below. These
    definitions are intended to provide clarity and reduce ambiguity in interpreting the terms and obligations contained
    herein.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Provider:</strong> Refers to Tool_4 and its authorized representatives responsible for
        delivering the AI Analytics services described in this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Customer:</strong> The corporate entity or organization contracting the Service Provider for access to
        and use of the Tool_4 platform. In some contexts, "Customer" may be used interchangeably with "Client."
    </li>
    <li><strong>User:</strong> Any individual personnel authorized by the Customer to access and utilize the Tool_4
        services, including but not limited to data analysts, IT administrators, and decision-makers. Occasionally, the
        term "User" may also refer broadly to the Customer entity itself, depending on context, which may cause
        interpretational inconsistencies.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Service Availability:</strong> The time period during which the Tool_4 platform is operational and
        accessible to the Customer/User, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and unforeseen outages.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Scheduled Maintenance:</strong> Pre-planned downtime during which the Service Provider performs updates,
        patches, or other necessary actions to maintain or improve the Tool_4 platform. The notice period for scheduled
        maintenance is generally provided 24 hours in advance, although exceptions may apply in emergency scenarios.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Retention Period:</strong> The duration for which the Service Provider stores the Customer's
        analytics data. While this Agreement specifies a minimum retention of six months post-termination, anonymized
        data may be retained indefinitely for unspecified purposes, creating potential conflicts with data deletion
        requests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reasonable Period:</strong> A timeframe deemed appropriate by the Service Provider to resolve issues or
        interruptions. This term is intentionally vague and not explicitly defined in this Agreement, leaving room for
        interpretation based on the nature of the incident.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Where inconsistencies arise between terms such as "User," "Client," and "Customer," the context within each section
    should be referenced to discern the intended party. This may lead to some ambiguity in obligations related to access
    rights, data handling, and liability.</p>

<h2>Service Commitments</h2>
<p>The Service Provider commits to delivering the Tool_4 AI Analytics services with a focus on reliability,
    responsiveness, and quality consistent with industry standards. To this end, the Service Provider shall use
    commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the Service Availability reaches an uptime target of 99.5% measured on a
    monthly basis, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and force majeure events. However, the Service Provider does not
    guarantee uninterrupted service and acknowledges that emergency maintenance may occur without prior notification,
    potentially affecting access to critical functionalities.</p>
<p>Support services will be available during standard business hours, from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM local time, Monday through
    Friday, excluding Client-recognized holidays. The Service Provider shall respond to critical incident reports within
    two business hours and to non-critical inquiries within one business day. Notwithstanding these commitments, the
    term “reasonable period” may be applied to resolution timelines, the exact duration of which shall be determined at
    the sole discretion of the Service Provider, thereby introducing some ambiguity around response expectations.</p>
<p>Data security and confidentiality remain a priority; the Service Provider will implement appropriate administrative,
    technical, and physical safeguards to protect Customer data against unauthorized access. Nevertheless, the Service
    Provider disclaims liability for breaches arising from the User’s or Client’s failure to adhere to recommended
    security protocols. Furthermore, while the Service Provider endeavors to delete customer data promptly upon service
    termination, anonymized data may be retained indefinitely, which may conflict with certain Customer requests for
    complete data removal.</p>
<p>It is also noted that references to "User" and "Customer" within this section may vary in meaning, occasionally
    referring to individual personnel or the corporate entity respectively, which may impact interpretations of service
    obligations. Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to resolve any ambiguities that arise from such
    terminological inconsistencies.</p>

<h3>Availability and Uptime Guarantee</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall endeavor to ensure that the Tool_4 platform is available to the Customer with an uptime
    target of 99.5% measured monthly, excluding periods of Scheduled Maintenance and force majeure events beyond the
    Service Provider’s control. Scheduled Maintenance will typically be communicated to the User or Client at least 24
    hours in advance, except in emergency cases where notice may be shorter or omitted entirely. The Service Provider
    reserves the right to perform unscheduled maintenance or emergency remediation activities which may temporarily
    interrupt Service availability without prior notification.</p>
<p>Availability calculations will exclude downtime caused by factors outside the Service Provider's reasonable control,
    including but not limited to network failures, internet service provider outages, or issues originating within the
    Customer's IT environment. The Client acknowledges that such events may impact Service availability and are
    therefore not subject to the uptime guarantee.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider commits to promptly restoring Service following any unplanned outages, the term
    “reasonable period” shall be applied to define resolution times. This term remains undefined in this Agreement,
    potentially leading to differing interpretations between the Service Provider and the User regarding acceptable
    downtime durations. Furthermore, references to the “User” in this section are intended to mean the Customer
    organization as a whole, but may be inconsistently interpreted as individual personnel, which could affect
    responsibilities related to incident reporting and communication.</p>
<p>In the event that uptime targets are not met, the Service Provider agrees to review the circumstances with the Client
    and consider appropriate remedial actions or credits, subject to the sole discretion of the Service Provider.
    However, no explicit penalties or automatic compensation mechanisms are guaranteed herein. Both parties acknowledge
    that this limited scope of remedies may not fully address all potential impacts arising from Service
    interruptions.</p>

<h3>Performance Standards</h3>
<p>The Service Provider agrees to maintain performance standards for the Tool_4 platform that align with industry best
    practices for AI-driven analytics solutions. Key performance indicators shall include system responsiveness, data
    processing speed, and accuracy of predictive modeling outputs. While the Service Provider strives to achieve optimal
    performance, it does not warrant that system response times will be consistent under all conditions, particularly
    during peak usage or unforeseen technical issues.</p>
<p>System responsiveness is targeted to average response times of less than three seconds for standard queries during
    normal business hours. However, the Service Provider reserves the right to adjust performance targets dynamically
    based on evolving workloads and infrastructure changes, which may result in variable response times without prior
    notice to the User or Customer.</p>
<p>Data processing and analytics accuracy will be maintained through regular system updates and model recalibrations.
    Nevertheless, the Service Provider does not guarantee that all predictive insights will be error-free or actionable
    in every context. The Client acknowledges that the Service Provider’s obligations do not extend to outcomes based on
    the Client’s interpretation or application of analytics results.</p>
<p>In certain instances, the terms "User" and "Client" are used interchangeably within this section, which may cause
    confusion regarding responsibility for reporting performance issues. Additionally, while the Service Provider
    commits to remedying performance degradations within a reasonable timeframe, the term “reasonable” is not explicitly
    defined herein, leaving it open to interpretation by either party.</p>
<p>Finally, the Service Provider shall document and communicate any significant changes in performance standards or
    metrics to the Customer in a timely manner, though the specific notification period is not stipulated, possibly
    resulting in delayed awareness of such changes by the Client.</p>

<h3>Scheduled Maintenance and Downtime</h3>
<p>Scheduled Maintenance is an essential activity performed by the Service Provider to ensure the ongoing reliability,
    security, and performance of the Tool_4 AI Analytics platform. Such maintenance events include software updates,
    security patches, infrastructure upgrades, and other necessary interventions designed to minimize service
    degradation and prevent unexpected failures. The Service Provider shall endeavor to schedule maintenance during
    off-peak hours, typically outside standard business hours, to reduce impact on the Customer’s operations.</p>
<p>The Service Provider will provide advance notice of Scheduled Maintenance to the User at least 24 hours prior to the
    commencement of the maintenance window. However, in cases of emergency maintenance required to address critical
    vulnerabilities or system faults, such notice may be shortened or omitted entirely to expedite resolution. Customers
    are advised to monitor communications regularly to stay informed about upcoming maintenance activities.</p>
<p>During Scheduled Maintenance windows, certain features or functionalities of the Tool_4 platform may be temporarily
    unavailable or operate with limited capacity. While the Service Provider strives to limit downtime to a maximum of
    four hours per maintenance event, actual durations may vary depending on the complexity of the tasks involved. Any
    downtime experienced during these periods will not be counted against the Service Availability uptime targets
    specified elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
<p>It is understood that the terms "Customer" and "User" used within this section may sometimes refer to different
    entities—where "User" generally denotes authorized personnel within the Customer’s organization—potentially causing
    some ambiguity in responsibility for responding to maintenance notifications or coordinating operational
    adjustments. Furthermore, the Agreement does not explicitly define the criteria for what constitutes an emergency
    maintenance event, leaving the determination to the discretion of the Service Provider, which may lead to differing
    interpretations by the Client and the Service Provider.</p>

<h2>Support and Incident Management</h2>
<p>The Service Provider shall offer technical support services to the Customer to facilitate the effective use of the
    Tool_4 platform and to address any incidents that may arise during normal operations. Support will be available
    during standard business hours, defined as 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM local time, Monday through Friday, excluding
    Client-recognized holidays. Outside of these hours, support may be limited to critical incident escalation only,
    without guaranteed response times.</p>
<p>Incident reporting shall be initiated by the User or Client through designated communication channels provided by the
    Service Provider, including email and support portal submissions. The Service Provider commits to acknowledging
    critical incidents within two business hours and aims to resolve such issues within a reasonable period; however,
    the term "reasonable period" is not explicitly defined herein and may vary depending on incident complexity and
    resource availability.</p>
<p>For non-critical issues, response and resolution times may be longer and are subject to prioritization at the Service
    Provider’s discretion. In some cases, the Service Provider may require additional information or cooperation from
    the Customer's personnel to diagnose and remedy issues, and delays in Customer responsiveness may affect resolution
    timelines.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider endeavors to provide comprehensive support, it does not warrant uninterrupted assistance
    or immediate resolution of all incidents. Furthermore, references to "User," "Client," and "Customer" may be used
    interchangeably within this section, which could lead to uncertainty regarding which party holds responsibility for
    incident reporting and communication during the support process.</p>
<p>Upon resolution of incidents, the Service Provider will notify the Customer and provide a summary of actions taken.
    Both parties agree to collaborate in good faith to continuously improve incident management procedures and address
    recurring issues effectively. Notwithstanding these commitments, the Agreement does not guarantee any specific
    penalties or service credits related to incident resolution delays.</p>

<h3>Support Tiers and Response Times</h3>
<p>The Service Provider offers a tiered support structure designed to address the varying needs of the Customer's
    organization in utilizing the Tool_4 platform. Support is categorized into three tiers: Standard, Enhanced, and
    Premium. Each tier provides different levels of response priority, availability, and resolution targets. The
    Customer’s selected support tier will be specified in the applicable Order Form or Subscription Agreement.</p>
<p>Under the Standard Support tier, support is available during standard business hours only, with response times for
    critical incidents targeted within four business hours and non-critical inquiries addressed within two business
    days. Enhanced Support extends availability to include after-hours support during weekdays, with critical incidents
    receiving responses within two business hours and non-critical issues within one business day. Premium Support
    offers 24/7 coverage, with critical incident response guaranteed within one hour and expedited handling of all other
    requests.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these stated targets, the Service Provider reserves the right to adjust response and resolution times
    based on resource availability and incident severity; such adjustments will be communicated to the User or Client as
    deemed appropriate. The term “critical incident” is broadly defined as any event causing a total or substantial loss
    of Service functionality, though specific criteria may vary and are subject to the Service Provider’s sole
    discretion, potentially leading to interpretational discrepancies between the Customer and User.</p>
<p>Response times are measured from the moment the Service Provider acknowledges receipt of the incident report. It is
    the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that incident reports contain sufficient detail and are routed through
    approved channels to avoid delays. Inconsistent use of the terms “User,” “Client,” and “Customer” throughout this
    section and the Agreement may cause uncertainty regarding who is responsible for reporting and follow-up
    communications, particularly in organizations with multiple authorized personnel.</p>

<h3>Incident Reporting Procedures</h3>
<p>The Customer or User shall promptly report any incidents affecting the Tool_4 AI Analytics service through the
    designated communication channels specified by the Service Provider, which include the support portal, email, and
    telephone hotlines. Incident reports should contain sufficient detail to enable the Service Provider to assess the
    severity, scope, and potential impact of the issue. Incomplete or vague reports may result in delays in
    acknowledging and resolving the incident.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of an incident report, the Service Provider will acknowledge the report in accordance with the response
    times set forth under the Customer’s selected support tier. However, the Service Provider reserves the right to
    prioritize incident handling based on the perceived criticality of the issue, which may differ from the Customer’s
    initial classification. The Service Provider may also request additional information or clarification from the User
    or Client to facilitate timely resolution.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Customer to designate authorized personnel ("Users") who are permitted to report
    incidents and communicate with the Service Provider. The Agreement does not specify the maximum number of authorized
    Users, and the terms "User," "Client," and "Customer" may be used interchangeably in this section, which could lead
    to ambiguity regarding reporting authority and accountability.</p>
<p>Incident reports related to security breaches must be communicated immediately upon detection to minimize potential
    damage. The Service Provider will treat such reports with the highest priority, though resolution timelines remain
    subject to the undefined term “reasonable period” as referenced elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
<p>Failure by the Customer or User to report incidents in a timely and accurate manner may adversely affect the Service
    Provider’s ability to resolve issues promptly and may limit eligibility for any remedial actions or service credits.
    Additionally, the Service Provider disclaims liability for any losses resulting from delayed or improper incident
    reporting. Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to ensure effective incident management despite any
    potential terminological inconsistencies present in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Escalation Process</h3>
<p>In the event that an incident or service issue is not resolved within the initially agreed resolution timeframe, the
    Customer or User may initiate an escalation to ensure timely attention and resolution. Escalations should be
    submitted through the designated communication channels outlined in the Incident Reporting Procedures section. The
    Service Provider commits to acknowledging escalations within one business hour of receipt and will assign a senior
    technical resource to investigate and manage the issue thereafter.</p>
<p>The escalation process consists of three levels: Level 1 (Initial Support), Level 2 (Technical Specialist), and Level
    3 (Executive Review). The initial escalation (Level 1) involves the standard support team responding according to
    the Customer's selected support tier. Should the issue remain unresolved or the Customer deems the response
    unsatisfactory, the matter may be elevated to Level 2, where specialized personnel with deeper technical expertise
    will engage. If unresolved at Level 2, or if the Client requests, the issue may be escalated to Level 3 for
    executive management review and intervention.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider endeavors to resolve escalated issues promptly, the term “promptly” is not explicitly
    defined in this Agreement and may vary based on the nature and complexity of the incident. Furthermore, references
    to “Customer,” “Client,” and “User” throughout this process may cause some ambiguity regarding the exact party
    authorized to initiate or request escalations, especially in organizations with multiple authorized Users.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Client to ensure clear communication and cooperation during the escalation process.
    The Service Provider reserves the right to close an escalation if deemed resolved or inactive after a reasonable
    period of no response from the Customer or User. Notwithstanding the escalation procedures, the Agreement does not
    guarantee any specific service credits or penalties arising from unresolved escalations.</p>

<h2>Customer Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Customer acknowledges and agrees to fulfill certain responsibilities to facilitate the effective delivery and
    operation of the Tool_4 AI Analytics services. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing
    accurate and timely information necessary for service configuration, maintaining appropriate IT infrastructure
    compatible with the Service Provider’s requirements, and ensuring that authorized Users comply with the terms of

<p>It is the Customer’s obligation to designate authorized personnel ("Users") who are responsible for accessing the
    Tool_4 platform and reporting incidents or service issues. The Customer shall ensure that such Users are adequately
    trained and possess the requisite knowledge to utilize the Service in accordance with documented guidelines. Failure
    to do so may result in degraded service performance or delays in issue resolution, for which the Service Provider
    shall not be held liable.</p>
<p>The Customer must implement and maintain reasonable security measures to protect access credentials and prevent
    unauthorized use of the Service. In the event of any suspected security breach or unauthorized access, the Customer
    is required to notify the Service Provider immediately and cooperate in any investigations or remedial actions.
    However, the term “immediately” is not explicitly defined herein, which may lead to varying interpretations
    regarding the timeliness of such notifications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Customer agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to data privacy, export
    controls, and intellectual property rights in connection with the use of the Tool_4 services. The Customer remains
    solely responsible for the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of the data input into the platform. Any misuse
    of the Service or violation of this Agreement by the Customer or its Users may result in suspension or termination
    of access, subject to the Service Provider’s discretion.</p>
<p>In cases where the terms “Customer,” “Client,” and “User” are used within this section, they are intended to reflect
    the corporate entity and its authorized personnel respectively, although inconsistent terminology may occasionally
    cause interpretational challenges. Both parties agree to engage in good faith efforts to clarify and resolve any
    ambiguities arising from such inconsistencies.</p>

<h3>Access and Usage Requirements</h3>
<p>The Service Provider grants the Customer and its authorized Users access to the Tool_4 platform subject to the terms
    and conditions outlined in this Agreement. Access credentials, including usernames and passwords, shall be issued to
    designated Users by the Customer and must be safeguarded in accordance with best security practices. The Customer is
    responsible for managing User access rights and ensuring that only authorized personnel utilize the Service. Any
    suspected compromise of access credentials must be reported to the Service Provider without undue delay, although
    the term “undue delay” is not defined herein, potentially resulting in inconsistent notification timelines.</p>
<p>Use of the Tool_4 services is limited to the Customer's enterprise IT environment, and any access or usage outside
    the authorized scope is strictly prohibited. The Customer and Users agree not to engage in activities that may
    disrupt, degrade, or compromise the performance or security of the Service, including but not limited to
    unauthorized data extraction, reverse engineering, or attempting to gain unauthorized access to system components.
    The Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate access for Users found in violation of these terms;
    however, the process for suspension may vary and is not explicitly described, which could lead to differing
    interpretations between the parties.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges that while the Service Provider endeavors to monitor and enforce acceptable use policies,
    it cannot guarantee the prevention of misuse by Users. Furthermore, references to "User" and "Client" in this
    section are used interchangeably without explicit clarification, which may cause ambiguity regarding which party
    holds specific responsibilities for compliance and oversight. The Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
    Service Provider against any claims or damages arising from misuse or unauthorized access by its Users.</p>

<h3>Data Integrity and Security Obligations</h3>
<p>The Service Provider acknowledges the critical importance of maintaining data integrity and safeguarding the
    confidentiality of the Customer’s analytics data processed through the Tool_4 platform. To that end, the Service
    Provider commits to implementing reasonable administrative, technical, and physical controls designed to protect
    Customer data from unauthorized access, alteration, or loss. These controls include encryption in transit and at
    rest, access logging, and regular security assessments. However, the Service Provider does not warrant absolute
    invulnerability against all forms of cyber threats or data corruption.</p>
<p>The Customer, including its authorized Users, bears responsibility for ensuring that all data submitted to the Tool_4
    platform is accurate, complete, and compliant with applicable laws and internal policies. The Service Provider
    disclaims liability for any inaccuracies or errors arising from Customer-supplied data or from the Client’s failure
    to maintain adequate data validation procedures.</p>
<p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Service Provider shall delete all Customer data within a
    commercially reasonable timeframe. Nonetheless, anonymized or aggregated data may be retained indefinitely for
    benchmarking and service improvement purposes, which may conflict with certain Customer requests for complete data
    erasure. The term “commercially reasonable timeframe” is not explicitly defined herein, creating some ambiguity
    about the exact duration for data deletion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, references to “User,” “Client,” and “Customer” in this section may vary, sometimes denoting individual
    personnel and other times the corporate entity, potentially causing confusion regarding accountability for data
    security practices. Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to clarify responsibilities and remediate any
    security incidents promptly.</p>

<h3>Compliance with Terms of Use</h3>
<p>The Customer and its authorized Users agree to comply fully with all Terms of Use associated with the Tool_4 AI
    Analytics services as outlined in this Agreement and any supplementary documentation provided by the Service
    Provider. Compliance encompasses adherence to usage restrictions, security protocols, data handling requirements,
    and any applicable legal and regulatory obligations. Non-compliance may result in suspension or termination of

<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to monitor the Customer's and Users' activities to ensure conformity with the
    Terms of Use, including but not limited to usage patterns, data input integrity, and security compliance. However,
    the Service Provider does not guarantee real-time detection of all violations and disclaims liability for any harm
    arising from delayed identification or response to such breaches.</p>
<p>In the event of suspected or confirmed violations, the Service Provider will notify the Client or User as soon as
    practicable, though the timing of such notifications may vary and is not explicitly defined within this Agreement.
    The Client is responsible for investigating and remediating any issues internally and cooperating with the Service
    Provider during any compliance audits or investigations.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the terms “Client,” “Customer,” and “User” are used somewhat interchangeably throughout this
    section and the broader Agreement. While “Customer” generally refers to the corporate entity and “User” to
    individual personnel, the lack of consistent terminology may lead to some uncertainty regarding which party bears
    specific compliance obligations. Both parties agree to work collaboratively to resolve any such ambiguities in good
    faith.</p>
<p>Finally, this section does not supersede or limit any other compliance-related provisions contained elsewhere in this
    Agreement. The Customer remains solely responsible for ensuring that its use of the Service complies with all
    applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including export controls and data privacy requirements. Failure to
    adhere to these obligations may result in legal penalties and termination of Service without refund.</p>

<h2>Service Monitoring and Reporting</h2>
<p>The Service Provider shall implement comprehensive monitoring mechanisms to oversee the performance, availability,
    and security of the Tool_4 AI Analytics platform. Monitoring activities will include automated system health checks,

<p>Periodic reports summarizing system performance, uptime statistics, and incident occurrences will be furnished to the
    Customer on a monthly basis, or more frequently upon request. These reports aim to provide transparency into Service
    levels and support the Customer’s internal governance and compliance efforts. However, the frequency and format of
    reporting may be subject to adjustment based on the Customer’s selected support tier as specified in the applicable
    Order Form.</p>
<p>The Service Provider will endeavor to include actionable insights and recommendations within these reports to assist
    the Customer in optimizing usage and addressing any identified anomalies. Nevertheless, the Service Provider does
    not guarantee the completeness or accuracy of all reported data, as variations may occur due to system limitations
    or data collection intervals.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used interchangeably within the context of reporting
    distribution and access, potentially causing confusion regarding recipients of such reports. Furthermore, while the
    Service Provider commits to notify the Client promptly of any critical incidents detected via monitoring, the
    definition of "promptly" is not explicitly provided, which may lead to differing expectations about notification
    timing.</p>
<p>In cases where monitoring detects potential breaches or performance degradations, the Service Provider will initiate
    investigation and remediation procedures in accordance with the escalation and incident management protocols
    outlined elsewhere in this Agreement. Both parties agree to cooperate fully in addressing any issues identified
    through monitoring activities to maintain Service integrity and continuity.</p>

    uptime, response times, data processing throughput, and accuracy of predictive analytics outputs. Measurement of
    these metrics will be conducted on a monthly basis, with results reported to the Customer in accordance with the
    Service Monitoring and Reporting section.</p>
<p>System uptime shall target a minimum of 99.5%, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and force majeure events. Response
    times for standard queries are aimed to average less than three seconds during normal business hours, although
    fluctuations may arise due to peak usage or technical constraints. Data processing throughput will be monitored to
    detect any significant degradation that could affect analytics delivery.</p>
<p>Accuracy of predictive analytics is assessed through periodic validation against historical data sets and benchmark
    models. While the Service Provider commits to continuous improvement of these models, it does not guarantee that all
    predictions will be fully accurate or actionable in every scenario. The Customer acknowledges that performance
    outcomes depend in part on data quality and appropriate usage by authorized Users.</p>
<p>It is important to note that references to "User," "Client," and "Customer" within this section may be used
    interchangeably, which can create ambiguity regarding responsibilities for monitoring and reporting performance
    issues. Additionally, the Agreement does not specify exact thresholds or tolerance levels for performance
    deviations, leaving certain aspects open to interpretation by either party. The Service Provider reserves the right
    to adjust performance metrics and targets unilaterally with reasonable prior notice to the Customer, although the
    definition of “reasonable” is not explicitly provided herein.</p>

<h3>Reporting Frequency and Format</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall deliver performance and incident reports to the Customer on a standard monthly schedule,
    providing detailed insights into Service availability, system performance, and any incidents encountered during the
    reporting period. Reports will be furnished electronically via the designated communication channels agreed upon by
    the Customer and the Service Provider. Additionally, at the Customer’s request, the Service Provider may provide
    supplementary reports on a more frequent basis, subject to resource availability and prior agreement.</p>
<p>Reports shall include data visualizations, summary statistics, and narrative explanations intended to facilitate the
    Customer’s understanding and assessment of the Service’s operational status. The format of reports will generally
    conform to the templates provided by the Service Provider, which may be updated from time to time with or without
    explicit notification to the Client or User. The absence of a defined notification period for these template changes
    may result in occasional discrepancies between Customer expectations and report delivery.</p>
<p>The Service Provider commits to ensuring that reports are accurate and comprehensive to the best of its ability;
    however, limitations in data collection intervals or system processing may occasionally lead to minor discrepancies
    or delays in data representation. Such variances shall not be construed as breaches of this Agreement.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that references to “Customer,” “Client,” and “User” in this section may be used interchangeably to
    describe the intended recipients of reports, potentially causing confusion about the proper distribution and
    internal handling responsibilities. The Customer is responsible for disseminating reports appropriately within its
    organization and for ensuring that authorized Users are informed. Failure to do so shall not affect the Service
    Provider’s obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>In summary, while standard reporting will occur monthly, both parties recognize that the format and frequency of
    reports may be adjusted in consideration of operational needs and mutual agreement, though such adjustments are not
    explicitly governed by formal amendment procedures within this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Audit Rights</h3>
<p>The Customer shall have the right to conduct audits of the Service Provider’s compliance with the terms of this
    Agreement, specifically pertaining to data security, privacy, and adherence to performance obligations. Such audits
    may be conducted by the Customer itself or by an independent third party appointed by the Customer, provided that
    reasonable prior written notice is given to the Service Provider at least ten (10) business days in advance. The
    scope of any audit shall be limited to areas relevant to the Customer’s use of the Tool_4 platform and shall avoid
    undue disruption to the Service Provider’s business operations.</p>
<p>Audit activities may include, but are not limited to, inspection of security controls, review of relevant
    documentation, and verification of compliance with data handling and retention policies outlined in this Agreement.
    The Service Provider agrees to cooperate fully and provide access to necessary personnel, systems, and records
    during normal business hours. However, the Customer acknowledges that certain proprietary information or internal
    processes may be redacted or withheld to protect the Service Provider’s intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Audit findings shall be documented in a written report and shared with the Service Provider within a reasonable
    timeframe following the audit’s completion. The Service Provider commits to addressing any identified non-compliance
    issues promptly and in good faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not specify explicit remedies
    or penalties resulting from audit outcomes, and the term “reasonable timeframe” for remediation remains undefined,
    which may lead to differing interpretations between the Customer and User.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that references to "Customer" and "User" within this section may occasionally overlap or
    be used interchangeably, potentially causing ambiguity regarding which party holds specific audit initiation rights
    and responsibilities. Both parties agree to consult and clarify such ambiguities in good faith to ensure effective
    oversight and compliance monitoring.</p>

<h2>Financial Terms</h2>
<p>The Customer agrees to pay the Service Provider the fees set forth in the applicable Order Form or Subscription
    Agreement for access to and use of the Tool_4 AI Analytics services. All fees are due in advance on the first day of
    each billing cycle, unless otherwise specified. The Service Provider reserves the right to modify fees upon renewal
    of the Agreement, provided that the Customer is notified at least thirty (30) days prior to such changes.
    Notwithstanding this, the term “renewal” is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which may give rise to
    differing interpretations concerning contract extensions or automatic continuations.</p>
<p>Invoices will be issued electronically and are payable within thirty (30) calendar days from the invoice date. Late
    payments may incur interest charges at a rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is
    lower. Failure to remit payment within the specified period may result in suspension of Service until payment is
    received in full. However, the Service Provider retains sole discretion to waive or defer any late fees without
    prior notice to the Client or User.</p>
<p>All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, duties, or levies imposed by any governmental authority, all of which
    shall be the responsibility of the Customer. The Customer agrees to provide valid tax exemption certificates where
    applicable. In the event of any disputed charges, the Customer must notify the Service Provider within fifteen (15)
    days of the invoice date, or such charges shall be deemed accepted and payable. The Agreement does not explicitly
    define the process for dispute resolution related to billing, which may lead to ambiguity in handling such
    matters.</p>
<p>References to “Customer,” “Client,” and “User” within this section may be used interchangeably, potentially causing
    confusion regarding the party responsible for payment obligations, especially in scenarios involving multiple
    authorized Users or departments. Both parties agree to clarify billing contacts and responsibilities through
    separate communications to mitigate any misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Pricing and Payment Terms</h3>
<p>The pricing for the Tool_4 AI Analytics services shall be as specified in the applicable Order Form or Subscription
    Agreement executed by the Customer. Fees may be based on factors such as the selected service tier, volume of data
    processed, number of authorized Users, or other usage parameters defined therein. The Service Provider reserves the
    right to adjust pricing upon renewal or extension of the Agreement, with notification provided to the Client at
    least thirty (30) days prior to any such changes. However, the term “renewal” lacks a precise definition in this
    Agreement, potentially causing uncertainty as to whether automatic extensions or new contractual terms apply.</p>
<p>Payments are due in advance of service provision, with invoices issued to the Customer’s designated billing contact.
    Unless otherwise agreed, all amounts shall be payable within thirty (30) calendar days from the invoice date. The
    Service Provider may apply interest on overdue amounts at a rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum permitted by law,
    whichever is lower. Notwithstanding these provisions, the Service Provider retains sole discretion to waive, reduce,
    or defer fees or penalties without prior notification to the User or Client, which may lead to inconsistent
    application of payment terms.</p>
<p>All pricing and fees are exclusive of taxes, duties, and governmental charges, which shall be the responsibility of
    the Customer. The Customer agrees to provide valid tax exemption certificates when applicable. Disputes concerning
    invoiced amounts must be submitted in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days of the invoice date; failure to do
    so shall be deemed acceptance of the charges. The Agreement does not specify a formal dispute resolution process for
    billing disagreements, potentially resulting in ambiguity over handling unresolved payment disputes.</p>
<p>Throughout this section, the terms “Customer,” “Client,” and “User” may be used interchangeably without explicit
    clarification of billing responsibility, which could create confusion in organizations with multiple billing
    contacts or authorized Users. The parties agree to coordinate separately to clearly establish billing contacts and
    obligations to mitigate such ambiguities.</p>

<h3>Service Credits for SLA Breaches</h3>
<p>In the event that the Service Provider fails to meet the Service Availability uptime target of 99.5% in any given
    month, excluding periods of Scheduled Maintenance and force majeure events, the Customer may be eligible to receive
    service credits as a remedy for such breaches. To qualify for service credits, the Customer must submit a written
    claim within thirty (30) calendar days following the end of the month in which the SLA breach occurred. Claims
    submitted beyond this period may be rejected at the sole discretion of the Service Provider.</p>
<p>Service credits will be calculated as a percentage of the monthly service fees paid by the Customer for the affected
    period, based on the degree to which the uptime target was missed. Specific credit percentages and thresholds shall
    be detailed in the applicable Order Form or Subscription Agreement. However, this Agreement does not guarantee
    automatic issuance of service credits, and any credits awarded are subject to verification and approval by the
    Service Provider.</p>
<p>The Service Provider’s liability for SLA breaches shall be limited solely to the issuance of service credits and
    excludes any other damages, losses, or consequential liabilities. Furthermore, the Agreement does not explicitly
    define whether multiple SLA breaches within a single billing cycle may be aggregated for credit purposes,
    potentially leading to ambiguity in cumulative credit claims.</p>
<p>It is also noted that references to "Customer" and "User" within this section may be used interchangeably, which may
    create uncertainty regarding the party responsible for submitting claims and receiving credits. Both parties agree
    to clarify claim procedures and credit allocations through direct communication to mitigate any misunderstandings.
    Service credits, if granted, will be applied against future invoices and are non-refundable and
    non-transferable.</p>

<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<p>The Service Provider does not generally offer refunds for fees paid under this Agreement, except as expressly
    provided herein. Refunds are only considered in circumstances where the Service Provider has materially failed to
    deliver the Tool_4 AI Analytics services in accordance with the agreed Service Levels, and where such failure has
    been duly documented and verified through the Service Provider’s incident management and reporting mechanisms.</p>
<p>Customers seeking refunds must submit a formal written request within thirty (30) calendar days following the end of
    the billing cycle in which the alleged service failure occurred. Requests submitted after this period may be
    declined at the sole discretion of the Service Provider. All refund requests will be reviewed in good faith;
    however, the Service Provider reserves the right to deny any claim that does not meet the criteria set forth in this
    Agreement or any applicable Order Form.</p>
<p>It is expressly noted that refunds will not be issued for service interruptions attributed to Scheduled Maintenance,
    force majeure events, or any factors beyond the Service Provider’s reasonable control. Furthermore, the Agreement
    does not specify whether refunds apply to partial service disruptions or only to complete service outages, resulting
    in some ambiguity regarding eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>In the event a refund is granted, it will be calculated based on the pro-rata portion of the fees paid corresponding
    to the period of documented service failure. Refunds will be issued to the Customer’s designated billing contact
    using the original payment method, unless otherwise agreed. It is important to note that references to “Customer,”
    “Client,” and “User” may be used interchangeably within this section, potentially causing uncertainty as to which
    party is authorized to request and receive refunds.</p>
<p>Refunds, if any, shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to the Customer for service
    failures under this Agreement, and the Service Provider disclaims any liability for consequential, incidental, or
    punitive damages related thereto. Both parties agree to work cooperatively to resolve refund claims in a timely and
    equitable manner despite any terminological inconsistencies that may arise.</p>

<h2>Limitations and Exclusions</h2>
<p>Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, the Service Provider disclaims all warranties, express or implied,
    including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    The Tool_4 AI Analytics services are provided "as is" and "as available," and the Service Provider does not
    guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation under all circumstances.</p>
<p>The Service Provider shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages
    arising out of or related to the use or inability to use the Service, even if advised of the possibility of such
    damages. This limitation applies notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy provided
    herein.</p>
<p>Liability exclusions include, but are not limited to, damages resulting from: (i) unauthorized access or use of the
    Service by the Customer, Client, or User; (ii) Customer-supplied data inaccuracies; (iii) disruptions caused by
    third-party services or Internet connectivity; and (iv) delays or failures due to force majeure events.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that the terms "Client" and "Customer" may be used interchangeably in this section without
    explicit distinction, which could lead to uncertainty regarding the party against whom limitations apply.
    Additionally, while the Service Provider endeavors to maintain security and data integrity, it does not assume
    responsibility for any loss or corruption of data beyond the scope of its direct control. Notwithstanding previous
    provisions regarding data retention and deletion, the Service Provider reserves the right to retain anonymized data
    indefinitely, even if such retention conflicts with Customer requests for data removal.</p>
<p>The Service Provider’s total aggregate liability for any claims arising under this Agreement shall not exceed the
    total fees paid by the Customer during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. Any ambiguities regarding the
    interpretation of "reasonable period" or responsibilities of the User versus the Client shall be resolved in favor
    of the Service Provider. This section does not limit or exclude any liability that cannot be excluded by applicable
    law.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure</h3>
<p>Neither the Service Provider nor the Customer shall be held liable for any failure or delay in performing their
    respective obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by events beyond their
    reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest,
    governmental actions, labor strikes, pandemics, or interruptions in internet or telecommunications services
    (collectively, “Force Majeure Events”).</p>
<p>In the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the affected party shall promptly notify the other party in writing,
    describing the nature and anticipated duration of the event and its expected impact on performance. Both parties
    agree to cooperate in good faith to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon
    as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>Service Availability commitments and support obligations shall be suspended during the duration of any Force Majeure
    Event without liability for non-performance or delays. However, it is acknowledged that the term “promptly” is not
    explicitly defined within this Agreement, which may lead to differing interpretations concerning the timing of such
    notifications.</p>
<p>Should a Force Majeure Event continue for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days, either party may elect to
    terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party without penalty or further obligation, except for
    payment of fees accrued prior to termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, references to “User” and “Customer” in
    this section may be used inconsistently, occasionally referring to individual personnel or the corporate entity,
    which could create ambiguity regarding notification responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Service Provider shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide updates on the status of the Service
    during a Force Majeure Event, but does not guarantee the frequency or detail of such communications. Both parties
    acknowledge that no penalties, service credits, or refunds shall be owed due to performance failures attributable to
    Force Majeure Events, consistent with the limitations set forth in other sections of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Excluded Services</h3>
<p>Unless expressly stated in this Agreement or in a separate Order Form, the Service Provider shall not be obligated to
    provide services beyond the scope of the Tool_4 AI Analytics platform functionalities described herein.
    Specifically, the Service Provider excludes from its obligations any custom software development, on-premises
    deployment support, or third-party system integration services, which may be offered under separate agreements or
    professional services contracts at the Service Provider’s discretion.</p>
<p>The Service Provider shall also exclude responsibility for data migration, cleansing, or enrichment activities,
    unless such services are explicitly contracted. The Customer acknowledges that any data preparation necessary for
    optimal analytics performance is the sole responsibility of the Client or User, and failure to perform these tasks
    adequately may impact the quality and accuracy of the Service outputs. Additionally, while the Service Provider
    provides standard technical support and maintenance, the responsibility for managing and troubleshooting the
    Customer’s underlying IT infrastructure, including network connectivity and hardware performance, remains with the
    Customer.</p>
<p>It is further clarified that consulting services related to analytics strategy, interpretation of predictive models,
    or business decision-making are not included within the standard Service package and must be procured separately if
    desired. The Service Provider disclaims any liability or obligation for outcomes resulting from Customer or User
    decisions based on the analytics provided.</p>
<p>References to "Customer," "Client," and "User" within this section may be used inconsistently and without precise
    differentiation, potentially causing ambiguity regarding which party bears responsibility for excluded services.
    Moreover, while the Service Provider strives to update its service offerings regularly, the absence of explicit
    definitions for excluded services in certain instances may lead to differing interpretations between the Client and
    Service Provider.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Dependencies</h3>
<p>The provision and performance of the Tool_4 AI Analytics services rely on certain third-party technologies,
    platforms, and service providers ("Third-Party Providers") that support various components of the Service. These
    dependencies may include cloud infrastructure, data storage solutions, networking services, and software libraries
    that are integral to delivering the functionalities described in this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to manage and monitor its relationships with
    Third-Party Providers to minimize service disruptions and maintain compliance with applicable standards. However,
    the Service Provider does not guarantee uninterrupted access or performance of the Service in instances where
    failures or interruptions occur due to factors attributable to such Third-Party Providers.</p>
<p>In particular, the Client acknowledges that outages, degradation, or security incidents involving Third-Party
    Providers may impact the availability, accuracy, or security of the Tool_4 platform. The Service Provider shall
    notify the Customer of any known Third-Party Provider issues affecting the Service as promptly as possible, although
    the frequency and timeliness of such notifications are not explicitly defined herein, potentially leading to
    differing expectations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the responsibility for remediation or escalation related to Third-Party Provider failures may vary
    depending on the nature of the issue and the contractual arrangements between the Service Provider and those Third
    Parties. The Customer agrees that the Service Provider’s liability for any damages or losses arising from
    Third-Party Provider failures shall be limited to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and that no direct
    claims against Third-Party Providers shall be pursued by the Customer without prior written consent from the Service
    Provider.</p>
<p>It is also noted that references to “User,” “Client,” and “Customer” within this section may not be consistently
    applied, which could cause ambiguity regarding the party responsible for coordinating with the Service Provider on
    matters involving Third-Party dependencies. Both parties agree to communicate and cooperate in good faith to resolve
    any such ambiguities that may arise.</p>

<h2>Termination and Renewal</h2>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other party at least thirty (30)
    calendar days prior to the intended termination date. Termination may be effected for any reason, including but not
    limited to breach of material obligations, insolvency, or mutual agreement. Upon termination, the Service Provider
    shall cease providing access to the Tool_4 AI Analytics services and the Customer shall promptly pay all outstanding
    fees accrued up to the termination date.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate Service immediately if the Customer or any authorized
    User materially breaches this Agreement, including violations of security protocols or misuse of the Service. In
    such cases, prior notice may not be required, although the Service Provider will endeavor to inform the Client or
    User as soon as practicable. Conversely, the Customer may terminate for convenience by providing the required notice
    without penalty.</p>
<p>Renewal of this Agreement shall occur automatically upon expiration of the initial term unless either party provides
    written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the end of the then-current term.
    Notwithstanding this, the term “renewal” is not explicitly defined and may be interpreted differently by the Service
    Provider and the Customer, potentially leading to disputes regarding automatic extensions versus new contractual
    agreements.</p>
<p>Following termination or non-renewal, the Service Provider will retain the Customer's data for a minimum of sixty
    (60) days to allow for data export or transition. After this period, the Service Provider will delete all Customer
    data except for anonymized data retained indefinitely for benchmarking and service improvement, which may conflict
    with certain Customer requests for complete data erasure.</p>
<p>References to “Client,” “Customer,” and “User” within this section may be used inconsistently, occasionally causing
    ambiguity concerning which party holds specific termination rights or obligations. Both parties agree to clarify and
    resolve any such ambiguities in good faith to facilitate orderly contract cessation or renewal.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon the occurrence of certain conditions as set forth herein. In
    addition to termination rights described under the Termination and Renewal section, the Service Provider reserves
    the right to terminate the Agreement immediately if the Customer, Client, or any authorized User materially breaches
    any provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to failure to pay fees, violation of security protocols,
    or unauthorized use of the Tool_4 platform. Such termination may be effected without prior notice, although the
    Service Provider will endeavor to notify the User or Customer as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other party becomes insolvent, files for
    bankruptcy, or ceases operations. Termination for cause requires written notice specifying the breach or condition
    and providing a cure period of thirty (30) calendar days, unless the breach is not reasonably remediable, in which
    case immediate termination may be exercised.</p>
<p>Termination for convenience by the Customer shall be subject to the thirty (30) calendar days’ prior written notice
    requirement; however, the Agreement does not explicitly define the consequences or obligations upon such termination
    beyond outstanding fee payments, potentially leading to uncertainties regarding early termination liabilities or
    data handling responsibilities.</p>
<p>In cases where termination occurs, the Service Provider shall cease all Service delivery and, except as otherwise
    provided herein, delete Customer data within a commercially reasonable timeframe. Notwithstanding this, anonymized
    data may continue to be retained indefinitely for service improvement purposes, which may conflict with the
    Customer’s expectations for data deletion. The terms "Customer," "User," and "Client" are used interchangeably in
    this section, which may cause ambiguity about which party’s actions or rights trigger termination and related
    obligations.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to ensure an orderly termination process, including data export and
    transition assistance, subject to the limitations and timelines set forth in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Renewal Terms</h3>
<p>Upon expiration of the initial term or any subsequent renewal term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for
    successive periods of equal duration unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30)
    calendar days prior to the end of the then-current term. The term "renewal" as used herein is intended to mean the
    continuation of the Agreement under the same terms and conditions; however, the absence of an explicit definition
    for "renewal" in this Agreement may give rise to differing interpretations regarding whether modifications to terms
    or fees constitute a new agreement or an extension of the existing one.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to modify fees, service levels, or other material terms upon renewal,
    provided that the Customer is notified in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance. Failure by the
    Customer or User to provide timely notice of non-renewal shall be deemed acceptance of any such modifications and
    continuation of the Agreement. Notwithstanding this, the Agreement does not specify the method or form by which
    renewal notices must be delivered, which could lead to disputes over the validity or timing of such
    communications.</p>
<p>In the event of renewal, all obligations, rights, and responsibilities of the Service Provider and the Customer shall
    remain in full force and effect unless otherwise expressly modified in writing and agreed upon by both parties.
    References to "Customer," "Client," and "User" in this section may be used interchangeably without explicit
    differentiation, potentially causing ambiguity about which party is responsible for providing renewal notices or
    accepting amended terms.</p>
<p>Should the Customer wish to renegotiate terms or upgrade service tiers prior to a renewal date, such requests must be
    submitted in writing and agreed upon by the Service Provider in advance of the renewal. Absent such agreement, the
    Agreement will renew under the existing terms. Both parties agree to engage in good faith discussions to resolve any
    ambiguities related to renewal timing and conditions to avoid inadvertent continuation or termination of
    services.</p>

<h3>Post-Termination Obligations</h3>
<p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Service Provider shall cease all provision of the Tool_4 AI
    Analytics services to the Customer and shall initiate the process of data deletion in accordance with the terms set
    forth herein. The Service Provider agrees to retain the Customer’s analytics data for a minimum period of sixty (60)
    days following termination to facilitate data export or transition activities. After this period, the Service
    Provider will delete all Customer-specific data, except for anonymized or aggregated data, which may be retained
    indefinitely for benchmarking and service improvement purposes. This indefinite retention may conflict with certain
    Customer requests for complete data removal, thus potentially leading to disputes regarding data privacy
    obligations.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges responsibility for securing any necessary backups or exports of their data within the
    provided retention window. Failure to do so may result in irreversible loss of access to such data following
    deletion. The Service Provider shall make commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Customer during the
    transition period; however, the scope and extent of such assistance are subject to the Service Provider’s discretion
    and may vary depending on resource availability.</p>
<p>All outstanding fees accrued up to the effective date of termination shall remain payable by the Customer. The
    Service Provider reserves the right to withhold final data exports or other transition services until all
    outstanding obligations are satisfied in full. The terms "User," "Client," and "Customer" used in this section may
    be applied interchangeably, which could cause ambiguity regarding which party bears specific post-termination
    responsibilities or rights, particularly in multi-user organizational contexts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any licenses or access rights granted under this Agreement shall immediately terminate upon expiration
    or termination, and the Customer shall certify in writing the destruction or return of any Service Provider
    proprietary materials as requested. The obligations set forth in this section shall survive termination to the
    extent necessary to ensure proper data handling, confidentiality, and closure of the contractual relationship
    between the parties.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its
    formation, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, the parties shall endeavor to resolve the matter
    amicably through good faith negotiations. Either party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice to
    the other party detailing the nature of the dispute and relevant facts. Both the Customer and Service Provider agree
    to cooperate promptly and in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable resolution.</p>
<p>If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through informal negotiations within thirty (30) calendar days
    following receipt of the written notice, either party may escalate the matter to mediation. Mediation shall be
    conducted by a neutral third-party mediator mutually agreed upon by the Customer and the Service Provider. The
    mediation process shall take place at a location agreed by both parties or, if no agreement is reached, at the
    Service Provider’s principal place of business. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally unless otherwise
    agreed.</p>
<p>Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute within a reasonable timeframe, either party may pursue binding
    arbitration. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the jurisdiction
    in which the Service Provider is headquartered, unless otherwise mutually agreed. The arbitration decision shall be
    final and binding on both parties, and judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent
    jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, without the necessity of mediation or arbitration. It is acknowledged that
    references to “Customer,” “Client,” and “User” in this section may be used interchangeably, which could cause
    ambiguity regarding which party is entitled to initiate dispute resolution proceedings. Both parties agree to
    clarify such roles through direct communication as needed.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    Service Provider is incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The parties agree that any
    disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
    courts located within that jurisdiction, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Customer acknowledges that certain provisions of this Agreement may be subject to
    mandatory laws applicable to the Customer’s place of business or data processing activities, which could supersede
    or modify the governing law specified herein. In such cases, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to
    reconcile any conflicting legal requirements to the extent practicable.</p>
<p>In the event of any inconsistency between this section and other provisions of the Agreement relating to dispute
    resolution or jurisdiction, the terms of this Governing Law section shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise.
    However, references to "User," "Client," and "Customer" within this section may occasionally be used inconsistently,
    potentially leading to ambiguity regarding which party is bound by the governing law and jurisdiction clauses.</p>
<p>The parties waive any objection to venue or jurisdiction based on inconvenient forum or similar doctrines, except
    where such waiver is prohibited by applicable law. If any provision of this section is found to be invalid or
    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
    effect.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to their performance under this
    Agreement, including but not limited to data protection, export control, and intellectual property laws. Where
    required, the Customer shall obtain all necessary consents and authorizations to comply with these legal
    obligations.</p>

<h3>Arbitration and Mediation</h3>
<p>In the event that disputes between the Service Provider and the Customer, Client, or User cannot be resolved through
    informal negotiations as outlined in the Dispute Resolution section, the parties agree to submit such disputes to
    mediation prior to initiating any binding arbitration. Mediation shall be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon
    neutral third party within thirty (30) calendar days following the failure of informal negotiations, unless
    otherwise mutually extended. The location for mediation will be selected jointly by the parties, or failing
    agreement, at the Service Provider’s primary place of business.</p>
<p>Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute within a reasonable timeframe, either party may proceed with binding
    arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules applicable to
    the jurisdiction where the Service Provider is incorporated, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. The
    decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final, binding, and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    Notwithstanding this, the term “reasonable timeframe” for mediation is not explicitly defined, potentially leading
    to differing expectations regarding the duration of the mediation process.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred during mediation and arbitration, except that the fees of
    the mediator and arbitrator(s) shall be shared equally. The parties acknowledge that references to "Customer,"
    "Client," and "User" in this section may be used inconsistently, which might cause uncertainty regarding the
    entities entitled to initiate or participate in mediation or arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, either party retains the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent
    jurisdiction at any time without first engaging in mediation or arbitration to prevent irreparable harm. Both
    parties agree to cooperate in good faith to address any ambiguities arising from inconsistent terminology and to
    ensure that dispute resolution processes are conducted fairly and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The parties agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought
    exclusively in the courts located within the jurisdiction of the Service Provider’s principal place of business,
    unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing. This jurisdiction shall apply regardless of any conflict of law
    principles that might otherwise dictate a different venue. The Customer hereby consents to the personal jurisdiction
    and venue of such courts and waives any objections based on inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement acknowledges that certain disputes may arise that involve Users,
    Clients, or Customers located in different geographic regions, which may be subject to mandatory local laws or
    regulations that could override the agreed jurisdiction. In such cases, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith
    to reconcile these jurisdictional differences to the extent practicable. However, the absence of a clear process for
    resolving such jurisdictional conflicts may result in ambiguity and potential delays in dispute resolution.</p>
<p>References to “User,” “Client,” and “Customer” within this section may be used inconsistently, with “User”
    occasionally referring to individual personnel and “Customer” or “Client” referring to the corporate entity. This
    inconsistent terminology may lead to uncertainty regarding which parties are bound by or entitled to invoke the
    jurisdictional provisions herein. Both parties agree to clarify such distinctions as necessary to ensure effective
    enforcement of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Finally, the parties waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any disputes arising under this Agreement,
    agreeing instead to have such matters decided by a judge in the designated jurisdiction. This waiver shall apply to
    all Users, Clients, and Customers despite the inconsistent usage of these terms throughout this Agreement, and
    notwithstanding any conflicting provisions elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Appendices</h2>
<p>The Appendices to this Agreement provide supplementary information, detailed specifications, and additional terms
    that support the primary provisions contained herein. These may include, but are not limited to, technical
    documentation, data processing addendums, security protocols, and service level measurement methodologies. Each
    Appendix forms an integral part of this Agreement and is subject to the same terms and conditions unless otherwise
    stated.</p>
<p>Appendices shall be referenced by their designated titles or identifiers within this Agreement and any related Order
    Forms. In the event of any inconsistency between an Appendix and the main body of this Agreement, the terms of the
    main Agreement shall prevail unless the Appendix explicitly states otherwise. However, certain Appendices may
    contain provisions that supersede or clarify specific sections, which should be reviewed carefully by both the
    Service Provider and the Customer.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to update or amend Appendices periodically to reflect changes in technology,
    regulatory requirements, or service enhancements. Notice of such updates will be provided to the Customer, but the
    timing and method of notification may vary and are not explicitly defined, potentially leading to differing
    interpretations of the effective date of such changes. The Customer agrees to review and acknowledge updates
    promptly to ensure continued compliance.</p>
<p>Throughout the Appendices, references to "Client," "Customer," and "User" may be used inconsistently, reflecting
    either the corporate entity or authorized personnel, depending on context. This inconsistent terminology may cause
    ambiguity in interpreting roles and responsibilities related to specific technical or operational requirements. Both
    parties agree to engage in good faith discussions to resolve any such ambiguities.</p>
<p>Where applicable, the Appendices may also include templates for reporting, incident escalation matrices, and contact
    directories. The Customer acknowledges responsibility for maintaining up-to-date distribution lists and ensuring
    that designated Users receive relevant communications. Failure to do so may impact the effectiveness of support and
    notification procedures outlined in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Glossary of Terms</h3>
<p>This Glossary provides definitions of key terms used throughout this Agreement to promote clarity and reduce
    ambiguity. Unless otherwise defined, capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below. It is acknowledged
    that some terms may overlap or be used inconsistently in various sections of this Agreement, which should be
    interpreted contextually.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Agreement:</strong> Refers collectively to this Service Level Agreement, including all Appendices, Order
        Forms, and related documents governing the provision and use of the Tool_4 AI Analytics services.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Client:</strong> Typically denotes the corporate entity contracting for the Service; however, in certain
        contexts, “Client” may be used interchangeably with “Customer” or even “User,” potentially causing
        interpretational discrepancies.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Customer:</strong> The legal entity subscribing to Tool_4 services and responsible for compliance with
        the terms herein. While often synonymous with “Client,” the term may sometimes be distinguished by the scope of
        contractual obligations or billing responsibilities.
    </li>
    <li><strong>User:</strong> Any individual authorized by the Customer or Client to access and utilize the Tool_4
        platform. This term may also, less commonly, refer to the Customer organization as a whole, which may give rise
        to ambiguity regarding accountability.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Retention Period:</strong> The minimum duration for which Customer data is stored following service
        termination, typically six months, although anonymized data may be retained indefinitely for service improvement
        purposes. This may conflict with data deletion requests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reasonable Period:</strong> A non-specific timeframe applied to various obligations such as incident
        resolution and data deletion. This term is not explicitly defined in this Agreement and is subject to
        interpretation by the Service Provider.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Scheduled Maintenance:</strong> Planned service interruptions for updates or improvements, generally
        notified 24 hours in advance, except in emergencies where notice may be shortened or omitted.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Service Availability:</strong> The period during which Tool_4 services are operational and accessible,
        excluding Scheduled Maintenance and force majeure events.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Parties are advised to review contextual usage of these terms carefully, as inconsistent application throughout this
    Agreement may lead to differing interpretations of rights, responsibilities, and obligations. Where ambiguity
    arises, the Service Provider’s interpretation shall generally prevail unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

<h3>Service Level Objectives (SLOs)</h3>
<p>The Service Provider establishes the following Service Level Objectives ("SLOs") as key performance indicators to
    measure and maintain the quality and reliability of the Tool_4 AI Analytics services. These objectives serve as
    targets to guide service delivery and form the basis for assessing compliance with this Agreement. The SLOs outlined
    herein are subject to periodic review and adjustment by the Service Provider, with notification provided to the
    Customer in advance, although the specific notice period is not expressly defined.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Service Availability:</strong> The Tool_4 platform shall maintain an uptime of at least 99.5% on a monthly
    basis, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Force Majeure Events. This availability target aligns with the
    commitments stated in the Service Commitments section, though it is acknowledged that emergency maintenance may
    temporarily affect access without prior notice.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Incident Response:</strong> Critical incidents shall be acknowledged within two (2) business hours, with
    resolution efforts initiated promptly thereafter. The term "promptly" is intentionally vague and subject to the
    Service Provider’s discretion based on incident complexity and resource availability.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Data Retention:</strong> Customer analytics data will be retained for a minimum of six (6) months
    following termination of service. However, anonymized data may be stored indefinitely for benchmarking and service
    improvement purposes, which may conflict with specific Customer requests for data deletion as described in other
    sections.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> System responsiveness targets an average query response time of less than
    three (3) seconds during standard business hours, acknowledging that actual response times may vary due to workload
    fluctuations and infrastructure changes.</p>
<p>For purposes of these SLOs, references to "Customer," "Client," and "User" shall be considered synonymous,
    notwithstanding prior distinctions made elsewhere in this Agreement. This interchangeable usage may introduce
    ambiguity in assigning accountability for meeting these objectives. The Service Provider and Customer agree to
    collaborate in good faith to clarify responsibilities as necessary to support effective monitoring and enforcement
    of the SLOs.</p>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<p>For all matters relating to the administration, support, billing, and general inquiries under this Agreement, the
    parties shall maintain up-to-date contact information to ensure effective communication. The Customer shall
    designate primary and secondary points of contact ("Contacts") authorized to act on its behalf for respective
    operational areas, including technical support, account management, and billing. The Service Provider will likewise
    designate corresponding representatives responsible for facilitating prompt and accurate responses.</p>
<p>The Customer agrees to provide the Service Provider with written notification of any changes to designated Contacts
    within five (5) business days of such changes. Failure to update contact details may result in delayed
    communications or missed notifications, for which the Service Provider shall not be held liable.</p>
<p>All official communications, including notices of Scheduled Maintenance, incident reports, service updates, and
    billing statements, will be sent electronically to the email addresses provided by the Contacts. The Service
    Provider may also use telephone or other reasonable methods for urgent communications. It is acknowledged that
    references to "Customer," "Client," and "User" within this section may be used inconsistently, which could create
    ambiguity as to which party or individual is the intended recipient of specific communications.</p>
<p>For technical support and incident reporting, the Customer should utilize the designated support portal or email
    addresses specified in the applicable Order Form or Subscription Agreement. Billing inquiries and payment matters
    should be directed to the Customer’s billing Contacts as identified in the Service Provider’s records. The Service
    Provider will endeavor to respond to all inquiries within the timeframes defined under the Support and Incident
    Management section of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not explicitly define the protocol for resolving conflicts arising
    from multiple or overlapping Contacts, which may lead to confusion or duplicated efforts. Both parties agree to
    cooperate and clarify responsibilities promptly to minimize any operational inefficiencies.</p>
