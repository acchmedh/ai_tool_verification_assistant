<p>In the event of termination, the User shall be responsible for retrieving any data stored within the platform prior to the effective date. The Service Provider shall not be liable for any data loss after termination, nor for any damages resulting from the cessation of the Service. Both Parties agree to cooperate reasonably to facilitate a smooth transition, and any ongoing liabilities or obligations accrued prior to termination shall survive such termination as specified herein.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>The termination of this SLA shall be governed by the provisions set forth herein and may occur under the following conditions:</p>

  <li><strong>Material Breach:</strong> Either Party shall have the right to terminate this SLA immediately if the other Party commits a material breach of its obligations and fails to cure such breach within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice specifying the breach.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal or Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Termination may occur if continuing the SLA would violate applicable laws, regulations, or regulatory directives, provided that the terminating Party provides written notice to the other Party within a reasonable timeframe to facilitate compliance.</li>
  <li><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> In cases where a force majeure event, such as natural disasters, war, or other unforeseen circumstances, materially impairs the ability of either Party to perform their obligations, either Party may terminate this SLA upon providing notice, unless the event is resolved within thirty (30) days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon termination, the Service Provider shall cease all support and access to the Service, and the User shall promptly return or destroy all proprietary information and data in their possession, subject to any applicable data retention policies. Both Parties shall cooperate to ensure an orderly transition, including the retrieval of data and the resolution of outstanding obligations. Termination shall not affect accrued liabilities or obligations that expressly or by their nature survive termination, including confidentiality and indemnity provisions.</p>

<h3>Liability Limitations</h3>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising out of or related to this SLA or the use of CollabCraft Pro, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or business opportunities, regardless of the cause of action, even if such damages were foreseeable. The Service Provider’s total aggregate liability under this agreement shall not exceed the fees paid by the User for the Service in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to such liability.</p>
<p>This limitation of liability applies to all claims, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and shall survive the termination or expiration of this SLA. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations set forth herein are a fair allocation of risks and are fundamental to the contractual relationship. The User remains responsible for maintaining adequate backups of its data and for implementing appropriate security measures on its end.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this SLA shall exclude or limit the liability of either Party for damages resulting from gross negligence, willful misconduct, or any breach of confidentiality obligations. Both Parties agree that these liability limitations are reasonable given the nature of the Service and the contractual context, and they shall apply unless explicitly prohibited by applicable law. This clause aims to allocate risks fairly and promote a sustainable partnership between the Parties.</p>

<h3>Appendix B: Metrics and Calculations</h3>
<p>This appendix delineates the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance and reliability of CollabCraft Pro in accordance with the Service Level Agreement ("SLA"). The metrics outlined herein serve as objective criteria for monitoring compliance, identifying areas for improvement, and facilitating transparent reporting to both Parties.</p>
<p><strong>System Availability</strong> shall be calculated as the percentage of total scheduled and unscheduled operational hours during which the Service is fully accessible to authorized users, excluding predefined maintenance windows. The formula employed is: <br>
  <em>System Availability (%) = [(Total Hours - Unplanned Downtime Hours) / Total Hours] x 100</em>. <br>
  Unplanned downtime shall include outages caused by system failures, security breaches, or other unforeseen disruptions, as recorded in the incident logs.</p>
<p><strong>Support Response Time</strong> shall be measured from the moment a support request or incident report is received via the designated support channels to the initial acknowledgment or action by the Service Provider. Response times will be categorized based on incident severity, with critical issues acknowledged within one (1) hour, and non-critical requests acknowledged within two (2) hours.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Resolution Time</strong> shall be determined from the time of incident report to the documented closure or resolution. This metric considers the severity classification, with critical incidents aimed to be resolved within four (4) hours and less severe issues within twenty-four (24) hours. The actual resolution times shall be logged and reviewed during performance assessments.</p>
<p>All metrics shall be aggregated monthly, and deviations from the targets shall be analyzed to inform continuous improvement initiatives. These calculations shall be documented and included in periodic reports to ensure transparency and accountability in service delivery.</p>
