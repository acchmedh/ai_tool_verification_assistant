<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, CollabCraft Pro, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your use or inability to use the Platform, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, data, or other intangible losses resulting from (i) errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in Content or information provided through the Platform; (ii) interruptions or delays in service; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or Content; or (iv) any other matter related to the Platform.</p>
<p>In no event shall CollabCraft Pro’s total liability exceed the amount paid by the Organization for the Platform during the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the claim. The limitations of liability set forth herein are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between the parties and reflect the allocation of risks between you and CollabCraft Pro. These limitations shall apply whether the claim is based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence), warranty, or any other legal theory.</p>
<p>Users and Organizations acknowledge and agree that the Platform is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. CollabCraft Pro does not guarantee that the Platform will meet your requirements or that access will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. You agree that your use of the Platform is at your own risk, and you shall be solely responsible for any damages resulting from such use.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of damages, so the above limitations may not apply in full. In such cases, liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. This section shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms and shall remain in effect for the duration applicable under relevant law.</p>

<h2>Termination and Suspension</h2>
<p>CollabCraft Pro reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Platform at any time and without prior notice if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms of Service, engaged in misconduct, or if such action is necessary to protect the integrity, security, or proper operation of the Platform. Termination may also occur upon the dissolution of the Organization, breach of contractual obligations, or at the request of the Organization or authorized personnel.</p>
<p>Upon suspension or termination, all rights granted to you under these Terms shall immediately cease, and you shall no longer have access to the Platform or any Content stored therein. You agree to cooperate with CollabCraft Pro in any reasonable efforts to facilitate the transition or to retrieve your data prior to termination, where applicable. The Organization shall remain responsible for any outstanding fees or charges accrued up to the date of termination.</p>
<p>In the event of termination, CollabCraft Pro shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from the suspension or termination of your access. This includes any loss of Content or data, which may be permanently deleted without notice unless otherwise specified in the applicable agreement. The provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination—such as ownership rights, confidentiality obligations, and limitations of liability—shall continue to apply indefinitely after such termination.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, CollabCraft Pro may revoke or modify your access rights immediately if it suspects unauthorized use, security breaches, or other violations of these Terms. The Platform’s termination or suspension does not exempt you from liability for breaches occurring prior to such action, nor does it affect any rights or remedies available to CollabCraft Pro under applicable law or contractual agreements.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Termination</h3>
<p>CollabCraft Pro reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Platform immediately and without prior notice under circumstances where it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have materially breached these Terms of Service, engaged in fraudulent activity, or otherwise acted in a manner detrimental to the security, integrity, or reputation of the Platform. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, unauthorized use of the Platform, misappropriation of proprietary information, or repeated violations of applicable organizational policies or legal obligations.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the Organization ceases to exist, fails to maintain the required contractual obligations, or breaches any material terms of the Service Agreement, CollabCraft Pro may elect to terminate the agreement and revoke access rights. Termination may also occur if the Organization becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or undergoes significant changes in ownership or control that impact its ability to comply with these Terms.</p>
<p>In cases where termination is initiated due to violation of these Terms, the Organization will be provided with notice of such action and, where appropriate, an opportunity to remedy the breach within a specified period, unless immediate termination is justified due to security concerns or legal requirements. Upon termination, all rights granted under these Terms shall immediately cease, and the Organization shall promptly cease all use of the Platform. CollabCraft Pro shall have no obligation to retain or provide access to any Content stored on the Platform after such termination, and the Organization shall be responsible for retrieving any necessary data prior to the termination date.</p>
<p>These conditions are intended to uphold the security, legal compliance, and operational stability of the Platform, and to protect the rights and interests of all parties involved. Termination under these conditions shall be without prejudice to any remedies or claims CollabCraft Pro may have arising out of or related to violations of these Terms or applicable law.</p>

<h3>Effect of Termination</h3>
<p>Upon the termination or suspension of your access to the Platform, whether initiated by CollabCraft Pro or your Organization, all rights granted to you under these Terms shall immediately cease, and you shall no longer be authorized to access, use, or reproduce any Content or materials contained within the Platform. Any obligations or liabilities incurred prior to such termination shall remain in effect, including but not limited to payment obligations and confidentiality commitments.</p>
<p>Following termination, CollabCraft Pro shall have no obligation to retain, store, or provide access to any Content or data associated with your account, and such Content may be permanently deleted without notice. You acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly set forth herein, CollabCraft Pro shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from the termination or suspension of your access, including the loss of Content, data, or opportunity.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections relating to Intellectual Property Rights, Confidentiality, Limitation of Liability, and any other provisions intended to survive termination shall continue to be in effect indefinitely. You agree to cease all use of the Platform immediately upon termination and to cooperate with CollabCraft Pro in facilitating the retrieval or deletion of your data, as applicable. If applicable, any ongoing obligations or liabilities, such as outstanding fees or legal claims, shall survive termination in accordance with these Terms or applicable law.</p>
<p>This section underscores the importance of the termination process and clarifies the consequences thereof, ensuring clarity regarding data handling, residual obligations, and the enforceability of surviving provisions.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which CollabCraft Pro is registered and operates, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, the use of the Platform, or any ancillary agreements shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that jurisdiction. Both parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections based on venue or inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>In the event of a legal dispute, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with the proceedings. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced with a valid, enforceable provision that most closely reflects the original intent.</p>
<p>By using the Platform, you consent to the jurisdiction and venue specified herein and agree to waive any objections to such jurisdiction or venue.
