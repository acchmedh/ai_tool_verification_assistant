<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>This section outlines the specific conditions under which either party may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth herein. Termination may be initiated for cause if either party materially breaches any of its obligations and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice from the non-breaching party. Such breaches may include, but are not limited to, violations of confidentiality, failure to pay fees, or unauthorized use of the platform.</p>
<p>In addition, this Agreement may be terminated without cause by either party upon providing at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the other party. Termination for convenience shall not relieve the Client of its obligation to pay all accrued fees up to the effective date of termination. The Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or deactivate access immediately if there is evidence of misuse, security breach, or legal violation, pending resolution or investigation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or ceases to operate in the ordinary course of business. Upon termination, the Client shall promptly cease all use of the platform and shall return or destroy all Confidential Information and related data, certifying such actions if requested. The Service Provider shall deactivate the Client’s account and remove residual data, subject to legal and contractual obligations. All outstanding payments shall become immediately due, and the parties shall cooperate to facilitate a smooth transition or data return process as applicable.</p>
<p>These termination conditions are intended to provide clarity and protect the interests of both parties, ensuring that termination occurs only under justified circumstances and with appropriate notice and procedural fairness.</p>

<h2>Liability and Indemnification</h2>
<p>Neither party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. The Service Provider’s total liability under this SLA shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Client for the services in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
<p>The Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Service Provider and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to: (i) any breach of the Client’s obligations under this SLA; (ii) unauthorized use or access of the platform by the Client or its Users; (iii) violation of applicable laws or regulations; or (iv) infringement of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations. The indemnifying party shall promptly notify the other party of any such claim and cooperate fully in the defense and settlement thereof.</p>
<p>Both parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability set forth herein are an essential basis of the bargain and that these provisions shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.

This liability and indemnification clause shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement to the extent necessary to address claims or liabilities arising prior thereto.</p>

<h3>Limitations of Liability</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, neither party shall be liable to the other for any damages arising out of or related to this SLA, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceeding the total fees paid by the Client to the Service Provider in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to such damages. This limitation applies to all direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, business interruption, or loss of reputation, even if such damages were foreseeable or the party has been advised of the possibility thereof.</p>
<p>In no event shall the Service Provider be liable for damages resulting from circumstances beyond its reasonable control, such as force majeure events, internet outages, or acts of third parties. The Client acknowledges that the platform’s performance and availability depend on the Client’s network environment, and that the Service Provider’s obligations are limited to the scope of services expressly outlined in this SLA.</p>
<p>Both parties agree that the allocation of risk set forth in this section reflects a fair and reasonable balance of potential liabilities and is an essential part of the consideration for the services rendered. This section shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.</p>

<h3>Indemnification Clause</h3>
<p>Each Party ("Indemnifying Party") agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party ("Indemnified Party") and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (i) any breach by the Indemnifying Party of its representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any negligence, misconduct, or willful misconduct committed by the Indemnifying Party or its personnel; (iii) infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights resulting from the use of the platform or services; and (iv) violations of applicable laws or regulations by the Indemnifying Party or its personnel. The Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any claim for which indemnification is sought, provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent that it is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall assume control over the defense of such claims, including selecting legal counsel, and shall cooperate fully with the Indemnified Party in such defense. The Parties agree that this indemnification obligation is a material inducement for entering into this Agreement and shall survive its termination or expiration to the extent of any claims arising prior thereto.</p>
