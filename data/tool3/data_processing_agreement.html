<h1>Data Processing Agreement</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This Data Processing Agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the terms and conditions under which Tool_3 ("Provider") will
    process personal and non-personal data on behalf of the Customer ("User") in connection with the use of the
    Provider’s AI-driven analytics platform. The purpose of this Agreement is to ensure compliance with applicable data
    protection laws and to define the rights and obligations of both parties regarding data processing activities.</p>
<p>The Provider offers an advanced AI analytics solution designed to enable data analysts to derive meaningful insights
    through visualization and predictive modeling. In performing these services, the Provider may process various
    categories of data, including sensitive and non-sensitive information, depending on the User’s configuration and
    usage.</p>
<p>Both parties acknowledge and agree that the term “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably throughout this
    Agreement to refer to the entity entering into this contract with the Provider. While this Agreement aims to clarify
    data handling responsibilities, certain provisions shall apply only when personal data is involved. The scope of
    processing activities includes collection, storage, analysis, and retention of data for a reasonable period
    necessary to fulfill the agreed-upon services.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exact duration of data retention shall be determined by the Provider based on its
    internal policies, which may vary. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to address any data protection
    requests or compliance obligations that may arise during the term of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this Agreement is to establish a clear and enforceable framework governing the processing of
    data by the Provider on behalf of the Customer. This framework ensures that all data processing activities comply
    with applicable data protection regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR) and other relevant privacy laws. The Provider is committed to implementing appropriate technical and
    organizational measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data processed through
    the Tool_3 platform.</p>
<p>Moreover, this Agreement aims to delineate the responsibilities and liabilities of both the Provider and the User
    concerning the collection, storage, use, and dissemination of data. It is understood that the data processed may
    include personal data, which requires heightened protection, as well as anonymized or aggregated data used solely
    for analytical purposes. The Customer acknowledges that the Provider shall retain the right to process the data for
    a period deemed necessary to comply with legal obligations or to fulfill the operational needs of the platform,
    which may not always align with the Customer’s own data retention policies.</p>
<p>It is also agreed that the Provider will notify the Customer of any changes to its data processing practices within a
    reasonable timeframe; however, what constitutes a “reasonable timeframe” is subject to interpretation and may vary
    on a case-by-case basis. This introduces some ambiguity regarding the speed and extent of such notifications.
    Additionally, while the term “User” is predominantly used to refer to the entity utilizing the services, certain
    clauses within this Agreement refer to the “Customer” without explicit clarification, potentially leading to
    confusion about the parties’ respective obligations.</p>

<h3>Definitions and Interpretations</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below unless the context
    clearly indicates otherwise:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>"Data Controller"</strong> means the entity that determines the purposes and means of the processing of
        Personal Data. In this Agreement, the term is used interchangeably with "Customer" and "User," although these
        terms may not always be strictly synonymous in all contexts.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Data Processor"</strong> refers to the Provider, Tool_3, which processes Personal Data on behalf of the
        Customer in accordance with the instructions provided under this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Personal Data"</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
        as defined under applicable data protection laws. This includes, but is not limited to, names, identification
        numbers, location data, or online identifiers.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Processing"</strong> encompasses any operation or set of operations performed on Personal Data, whether
        or not by automated means, including collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation,

        erasure, or destruction.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Anonymized Data"</strong> shall mean data that has been processed in such a manner that the individual
        to whom the data relates is no longer identifiable; however, the exact threshold for what constitutes
        anonymization is subject to the Provider’s discretion and internal standards.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Agreement"</strong> refers to this Data Processing Agreement, including any annexes and amendments
        hereto.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretations within this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms unless
    expressly defined herein. References to "the parties" mean both the Provider and the Customer collectively. Any
    ambiguity in terminology, such as the inconsistent use of "User" and "Customer" throughout the document, should be
    resolved by considering the context in which the term appears. Moreover, the term "reasonable period" used herein to
    describe retention or notification timelines is intentionally left undefined to allow flexibility, which may result
    in differing interpretations between the parties.</p>

<h3>Scope of Data Processing</h3>
<p>The Provider shall process data exclusively for the purposes set forth in this Agreement and any related service
    agreements executed between the parties. The scope of data processing includes collection, storage, analysis, and
    visualization of datasets submitted by the Customer, as well as the application of predictive modeling techniques to
    generate actionable insights. The Provider may also perform limited data aggregation and anonymization to enhance
    the overall analytics capabilities of the Tool_3 platform.</p>
<p>Data processed may comprise personal data, sensitive information, and anonymized datasets, depending on the
    Customer’s inputs and configurations. Notwithstanding this, the Provider reserves the right to retain copies of
    Customer data for backup and disaster recovery purposes for a period of up to five years, unless otherwise agreed.
    This retention period may conflict with the Customer’s expectation of data deletion upon termination of services, as
    described in Section 6, which stipulates immediate deletion of all Customer data upon contract expiration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider shall process data in accordance with the documented instructions provided by the Customer.
    However, it is acknowledged that the Provider may, from time to time, modify processing activities to improve
    platform performance or comply with legal obligations, without explicit prior consent, provided such changes do not
    materially affect the nature or purpose of processing. The term “Customer” and “User” continue to be used
    interchangeably throughout this section, which may create ambiguity in identifying the responsible entity for
    specific processing instructions.</p>
<p>Lastly, any third-party subprocessors engaged by the Provider to assist in data processing shall be subject to
    equivalent data protection obligations as outlined in this Agreement. The Provider commits to notifying the User of
    any intended changes concerning subprocessors within a reasonable period, though the exact timing of such notice is
    not strictly defined herein.</p>

<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>In the context of this Agreement, the Provider acts as the Data Processor, responsible for executing data processing
    operations strictly in accordance with the documented instructions issued by the Customer, who functions as the Data
    Controller. The Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect
    the data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. These measures
    include, but are not limited to, encryption, access controls, and regular security audits.</p>
<p>The Customer is responsible for ensuring the lawfulness of the data processing instructions provided to the Provider,
    including obtaining any necessary consents from data subjects and ensuring compliance with applicable data
    protection laws. The Customer shall notify the Provider promptly of any changes to these instructions or any
    requests from data subjects that may impact processing activities. It is understood that the Provider will rely on
    such instructions to perform its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to cooperate in handling data subject rights requests, including requests for access,
    rectification, or deletion. However, the Provider’s obligation to delete data is subject to its internal retention
    policies, which may extend beyond the Customer’s deletion requests. This could lead to discrepancies between the
    parties’ expectations regarding data erasure timelines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider shall inform the Customer without undue delay if it becomes aware of any data breach or
    security incident affecting Customer data. The term "Customer" is used predominantly in this section, although
    references to "User" may appear elsewhere, potentially causing uncertainty about which party bears specific
    responsibilities. Both parties shall designate representatives to manage data protection matters and ensure timely
    communication throughout the term of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Data Controller Obligations</h3>
<p>The Data Controller, referred to herein interchangeably as either the "Customer" or the "User," shall ensure that all
    data provided for processing complies with applicable data protection laws and that it has obtained all necessary
    consents and authorizations from data subjects prior to submission. The Controller is responsible for verifying the
    accuracy, relevance, and legality of the data it supplies and for maintaining records of such consents as required
    under regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Controller shall provide clear and unambiguous instructions to the Provider regarding the scope,
    purpose, and duration of the data processing activities. It is understood that any failure to provide precise
    instructions may result in delays or unintended processing outcomes, for which the Provider shall not be held
    liable. The Controller must also notify the Provider promptly of any changes to these instructions or any legal
    obligations that may affect the processing of the data.</p>
<p>In the event of a data subject exercising their rights—such as requests for access, correction, or deletion—the
    Controller is responsible for coordinating with the Provider to ensure timely and compliant responses. However, the
    Controller acknowledges that deletion requests may not be immediately actionable, as the Provider’s internal
    retention policies could require holding data for a period exceeding that requested by the Controller. This
    discrepancy may lead to temporary retention beyond the Controller’s expectations.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Controller shall implement appropriate security measures on its end, including secure data transmission
    protocols when transferring data to the Provider. Failure to do so may impair the Provider’s ability to guarantee
    the confidentiality and integrity of the data processed. It is further noted that the terms "Customer" and "User"
    are used inconsistently throughout this Agreement, and while the Controller is primarily the Customer, any ambiguity
    arising from such inconsistent terminology should be resolved in favor of the Controller’s responsibilities as
    outlined herein.</p>

<h3>Data Processor Obligations</h3>
<p>The Data Processor, herein referred to primarily as the "Provider," undertakes to process all data in strict
    accordance with the documented instructions provided by the Customer or User, as applicable. The Provider shall
    implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate
    to the risks associated with the processing activities, including but not limited to data encryption, secure access
    controls, and periodic vulnerability assessments. However, the Provider retains discretion to modify such measures
    periodically, provided that any such changes do not materially compromise the security or confidentiality of the
    data.</p>
<p>In fulfilling its obligations, the Provider shall ensure that all personnel authorized to process Customer data are
    bound by confidentiality obligations and receive adequate training on data protection principles. The Provider
    commits to notify the Customer promptly in the event of any suspected or confirmed personal data breach affecting
    the User’s data. Such notification shall be provided without undue delay but within a timeframe deemed reasonable by
    the Provider, which may vary based on the nature and severity of the incident.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider may retain copies of Customer data for backup, disaster recovery, or
    compliance purposes for a period longer than that requested by the Customer, which may result in retention beyond
    the termination of this Agreement. This retention practice may conflict with the Customer’s expectation of immediate
    data deletion upon contract termination, as outlined in Section 6, thereby creating a potential inconsistency in
    data handling policies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Provider may engage subprocessors to perform specific processing activities; however, the Provider
    remains fully responsible for ensuring that such subprocessors comply with the obligations set forth in this
    Agreement. The Provider shall endeavor to notify the Customer of any intended changes concerning subprocessors
    within a reasonable period, though the exact timing and scope of such notifications are not explicitly defined
    herein, potentially leading to ambiguity in communication expectations.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Subprocessors</h3>
<p>The Provider may engage third-party subprocessors ("Subprocessors") to assist in the performance of its data
    processing obligations under this Agreement. Such Subprocessors shall be selected with due care and must enter into
    binding agreements with the Provider that impose data protection obligations no less stringent than those set forth
    in this Agreement. The Provider remains fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors as if they
    were its own.</p>
<p>Prior to engaging any new Subprocessor, the Provider shall notify the Customer either via email or through the
    administrative dashboard of the Tool_3 platform. This notification will generally be provided within a reasonable
    notification period; however, the exact duration of this period is not specifically defined in this Agreement and
    may vary depending on the circumstances. The Customer shall have the right to object to the engagement of a
    particular Subprocessor within ten (10) business days following receipt of such notice. Should the Customer object,
    the parties agree to cooperate in good faith to resolve the concern, which may include the Provider ceasing to use
    the contested Subprocessor where feasible.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that certain emergency situations or legal obligations may compel the Provider to engage
    Subprocessors on short notice, in which case prior notification may be impractical. In such instances, the Provider
    will inform the Customer as soon as reasonably possible after the engagement. The terms "Customer" and "User"
    continue to be used interchangeably in this section, potentially leading to some uncertainty regarding which party
    holds the objection rights described herein.</p>
<p>Subprocessors shall only process data in accordance with the documented instructions provided by the Provider and
    consistent with this Agreement. The Provider shall conduct regular audits and assessments to verify the
    Subprocessors’ compliance with applicable data protection requirements. Notwithstanding these measures, the Provider
    does not guarantee the immediate cessation of Subprocessor processing activities upon termination of this Agreement,
    which may result in residual data retention beyond the anticipated timeline.</p>

<h2>Data Processing Details</h2>
<p>The Provider shall process the data submitted by the Customer strictly in accordance with the documented instructions
    and the purposes outlined in this Agreement. Processing activities include data ingestion, transformation, analysis,
    storage, and visualization, as well as the application of predictive modeling techniques to generate actionable
    business insights. The Provider will utilize advanced AI algorithms and machine learning models to enhance the
    analytical capabilities of the Tool_3 platform, which may involve iterative training on Customer data to improve
    predictive accuracy.</p>
<p>Data processing shall be conducted using secure infrastructure hosted in jurisdictions compliant with relevant data
    protection laws. The Provider reserves the right to transfer data to subprocessors located in different countries,
    provided that such transfers comply with applicable legal requirements and that adequate safeguards are implemented.
    The Customer acknowledges and agrees that such cross-border data transfers may occur, though specific subprocessors
    and their locations will be communicated as per the notification procedures described in Section 5.</p>
<p>The retention period for processed data shall generally align with the Customer’s instructions; however, the Provider
    may retain data beyond such period for backup, archival, or legal compliance purposes. This may lead to retention
    durations exceeding Customer expectations. Furthermore, it is understood that the Provider may anonymize certain
    datasets to facilitate aggregate analysis, but the exact criteria and methods for anonymization are determined at
    the Provider’s discretion without explicit Customer approval, which could raise concerns regarding data
    identifiability.</p>
<p>Finally, while the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably in this Agreement, this section predominantly
    refers to the "Customer" as the party responsible for providing processing instructions. Any ambiguity arising from
    inconsistent terminology should be resolved by interpreting the obligations in favor of the Customer’s role as Data
    Controller.</p>

<h3>Categories of Data</h3>
<p>The types of data processed by the Provider under this Agreement encompass various categories that may include, but
    are not limited to, personal data, sensitive personal data, anonymized data, and aggregated datasets. Personal data
    primarily consists of information that directly or indirectly identifies an individual, such as names, contact
    details, IP addresses, and user identifiers. Sensitive personal data may include health-related information, racial
    or ethnic origin, and biometric data, which requires enhanced protection measures in accordance with applicable
    laws.</p>
<p>In addition to personal data, the Provider may process anonymized data derived from the Customer's datasets. Notably,
    the threshold for what constitutes anonymization is determined solely by the Provider’s internal standards, which
    may result in some ambiguity as to whether certain data remains identifiable. Furthermore, aggregated data generated
    through the Tool_3 platform may be used for analytical purposes and shared in a manner that ostensibly protects
    individual privacy, although the possibility of re-identification cannot be entirely excluded.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Provider collects metadata related to data processing activities, including
    timestamps, system logs, and usage statistics, which may contain indirect identifiers. The Provider retains the
    right to use such metadata for operational monitoring and platform improvement. However, the extent to which this
    metadata is considered personal or non-personal data is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, potentially
    resulting in interpretive discrepancies between the Provider and the Customer.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, this section
    primarily refers to the Customer as the source of data inputs. Any inconsistent terminology should be interpreted in
    favor of the Customer's responsibilities as the Data Controller. The Provider commits to processing only the
    categories of data necessary to fulfill the contractual purposes and shall not intentionally process any data
    outside the scope defined herein without prior notification and consent from the Customer.</p>

<h3>Purpose of Processing</h3>
<p>The Provider shall process data strictly for the purposes expressly set forth in this Agreement and any supplementary
    agreements entered into by the parties. The primary purpose of processing is to enable the Customer to leverage the
    advanced AI-driven analytics capabilities of the Tool_3 platform, including but not limited to data visualization,
    predictive modeling, and generation of actionable insights from complex datasets. This processing supports the
    Customer’s business objectives related to data analysis, decision-making, and operational optimization.</p>
<p>In addition to the core analytical functions, processing may also include incidental activities such as data
    aggregation, anonymization, and metadata collection aimed at enhancing platform performance, security, and
    reliability. The Provider reserves the right to utilize anonymized or aggregated data for internal research and
    development purposes without further consent from the Customer, provided that such use does not permit
    re-identification of individuals.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider may occasionally process data beyond the Customer’s original instructions
    to comply with legal obligations or to investigate and resolve security incidents. Such processing shall be
    conducted in a manner consistent with applicable laws and with reasonable efforts to minimize the impact on the
    Customer’s data privacy. However, the precise scope and limitations of this exception are not exhaustively defined
    herein, which may give rise to interpretive differences between the parties.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that the terms “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably throughout this
    section, which may introduce some ambiguity regarding the entity responsible for authorizing specific processing
    activities. The parties agree to clarify such ambiguities through mutual consultation to ensure alignment with the
    intended purpose of data processing under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Retention and Deletion Policies</h3>
<p>The Provider shall retain Customer data only for the duration necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
    Agreement and any applicable legal requirements. Generally, data will be retained for a period consistent with the
    Customer’s documented instructions; however, the Provider reserves the right to retain data for additional periods
    for backup, archival, or compliance purposes. This may include retaining data for up to five years after termination
    of services, which could conflict with the Customer’s expectation of immediate deletion upon contract expiration as
    described elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
<p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Provider commits to delete or anonymize Customer data "without
    undue delay." Nevertheless, the term "without undue delay" is not explicitly defined herein, which may result in
    differing interpretations between the Provider and the User regarding the exact timing for data deletion.
    Furthermore, the Provider’s internal retention policies may require preservation of certain data beyond the
    Customer’s deletion requests, particularly where legal obligations or operational needs exist.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges that residual copies of data may persist in backup media for a reasonable period, which is
    not specifically quantified in this Agreement. While the Provider strives to permanently delete all Customer data in
    accordance with this section, the potential for temporary residual data retention remains. Notably, the terms
    "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably throughout this section, which may create uncertainty as to the party
    responsible for initiating deletion requests or verifying completion of data erasure.</p>
<p>Any requests for early deletion or modification of data retention periods must be communicated in writing to the
    Provider. The Provider agrees to review such requests in good faith but does not guarantee immediate compliance if
    doing so conflicts with its internal policies or applicable legal mandates. The parties agree to cooperate to
    reconcile any discrepancies in retention expectations to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and
    contractual obligations.</p>

<h2>Security Measures</h2>
<p>The Provider is committed to maintaining a robust security framework designed to protect the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of Customer data processed through the Tool_3 platform. To this end, the Provider
    implements a combination of technical, administrative, and physical safeguards that meet industry standards and
    comply with applicable data protection laws. These measures include, but are not limited to, data encryption in
    transit and at rest, multi-factor authentication for access to sensitive systems, regular vulnerability assessments,
    and continuous monitoring of network security.</p>
<p>Access to Customer data is strictly limited to authorized personnel who require such access to perform their duties
    and who are bound by confidentiality obligations. The Provider conducts periodic security training for its employees
    to ensure awareness of data protection principles and incident response protocols. Additionally, security audits are
    performed at regular intervals to verify compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these commitments, the Provider retains discretion to update or modify security controls as
    technological and regulatory environments evolve. Such changes will be implemented in a manner intended to maintain
    or enhance existing protections; however, the exact timing and scope of these updates may not always be communicated
    in advance to the Customer, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding the current security posture. Furthermore,
    while the term "Customer" is primarily used in this section, references to "User" may appear in related security
    documentation, which could cause minor confusion regarding responsibility for security oversight.</p>
<p>In the event of a security breach or suspected compromise affecting Customer data, the Provider shall notify the
    Customer without undue delay, though the precise definition of "undue delay" is not specified herein and may vary
    depending on the circumstances. The Provider will cooperate with the Customer to investigate the incident and
    mitigate any potential impact. Overall, these security measures aim to ensure a high level of protection while
    allowing necessary flexibility to adapt to emerging threats and operational needs.</p>

<h3>Technical and Organizational Safeguards</h3>
<p>The Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect
    Customer data against unauthorized access, accidental loss, alteration, or destruction. These safeguards include,
    but are not limited to, encryption protocols, secure access controls, regular penetration testing, and comprehensive
    audit trails to ensure accountability and traceability of data processing activities. The Provider’s security
    framework is aligned with industry best practices and relevant regulatory standards, ensuring a consistent approach
    to risk management across all levels of operation.</p>
<p>Access to Customer data is restricted on a need-to-know basis to authorized personnel who have undergone background
    checks and data protection training. The Provider employs multi-factor authentication and role-based access controls
    to limit exposure of sensitive information. Furthermore, the Provider commits to conducting periodic reviews of
    access privileges to minimize risks associated with excessive or outdated permissions.</p>
<p>Organizational measures include the establishment of incident response teams and clear escalation procedures to
    promptly address security incidents. While the Provider endeavors to notify the Customer or User of any breaches or
    vulnerabilities without undue delay, the term “undue delay” remains undefined, which may lead to differing
    expectations regarding notification timelines. Additionally, although this section primarily references the
    “Customer,” occasional use of the term “User” persists, which may cause minor confusion about the party entitled to
    receive such notifications.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these safeguards, the Provider reserves the right to update or enhance its security measures as
    technological advancements arise, without prior explicit consent from the Customer. Such updates will be implemented
    with the intent to maintain or improve data protection; however, the lack of a defined notification period for these
    changes introduces ambiguity concerning the Customer’s awareness and approval. The Provider encourages ongoing
    collaboration with the Customer to ensure that safeguards remain effective and responsive to evolving threats.</p>

<h3>Incident Response and Notification</h3>
<p>In the event of a data breach or any security incident that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or
    availability of Customer data, the Provider shall activate its incident response procedures promptly. The Provider
    commits to investigating the incident thoroughly and taking all necessary remedial actions to mitigate any potential
    harm. Notification to the Customer or User shall be made without undue delay, though the exact timing for such
    notification is subject to the Provider’s discretion and may vary depending on the nature and severity of the
    incident.</p>
<p>Upon becoming aware of a breach, the Provider will notify the Customer through the primary contact channels
    previously established, which may include email, phone, or the Tool_3 administrative dashboard. The notification
    will include, to the best of the Provider’s knowledge at the time, a description of the incident, the categories of
    data affected, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach. However, due to the iterative nature of
    incident investigations, updates may be provided on a non-regular basis, potentially leading to some uncertainty as
    to the status of the response.</p>
<p>While the Provider endeavors to notify the Customer expediently, the term "without undue delay" is not explicitly
    defined, which may create ambiguity regarding the expected response times. Furthermore, the use of both "Customer"
    and "User" terminology in this section without clear distinction could cause confusion about the responsible party
    to receive and act upon such notifications.</p>
<p>The Provider shall cooperate fully with the Customer in managing post-incident activities, including regulatory
    reporting obligations and communication with affected data subjects where applicable. Nevertheless, the Provider
    retains the discretion to determine the appropriate scope and timing of these activities consistent with legal
    requirements and operational capabilities.</p>

<h2>Compliance with Legal Frameworks</h2>
<p>The Provider commits to conducting all data processing activities in compliance with applicable data protection laws
    and regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer
    Privacy Act (CCPA), and other relevant international, federal, or state privacy statutes. The Provider shall
    maintain appropriate certifications and conduct periodic audits to demonstrate adherence to these legal frameworks.
    Nevertheless, the precise scope of compliance efforts may vary depending on the jurisdiction and evolving regulatory
    requirements.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges its role as the Data Controller and is responsible for ensuring that all data submitted for
    processing complies with applicable legal standards, including obtaining necessary consents from data subjects and
    providing requisite privacy notices. The Provider shall assist the Customer in fulfilling its obligations upon
    reasonable request, although the timeliness and extent of such assistance may be subject to operational constraints
    and internal policies.</p>
<p>In instances where conflicting legal obligations arise between jurisdictions—such as data localization requirements
    versus cross-border transfer restrictions—the Provider shall endeavor to resolve such conflicts in a manner that
    seeks to uphold the highest standards of data protection. However, the Agreement does not specify explicit
    mechanisms for resolving such conflicts, which could result in ambiguity concerning the parties’
    responsibilities.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to address any regulatory inquiries or investigations related to data
    processing activities under this Agreement. The terms "Customer" and "User" continue to be used inconsistently
    within this section, potentially causing uncertainty about the responsible party for compliance-related
    communications. The Provider encourages ongoing dialogue to clarify such matters to avoid misunderstandings and
    ensure that legal obligations are met in a timely and effective manner.</p>

<h3>GDPR Compliance</h3>
<p>The Provider acknowledges its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and commits to
    processing personal data in accordance with its principles and requirements. This includes ensuring lawfulness,
    fairness, and transparency in processing, as well as adhering to the principles of data minimization, accuracy,
    storage limitation, and integrity and confidentiality. The Provider shall assist the Customer, acting as the Data
    Controller, in fulfilling its GDPR obligations, including responding to data subject access requests, data
    portability, and the right to be forgotten, subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider retains the discretion to process certain data for backup and archival
    purposes beyond the Customer’s direct deletion requests, which may be viewed as conflicting with the GDPR’s storage
    limitation principle. Such retention shall be limited to the minimum period necessary to comply with legal
    obligations or internal policies, though the exact duration remains unspecified and may vary. This introduces some
    ambiguity regarding how long Customer data may be retained post-termination or deletion request.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms "User" and "Customer" continue to be used interchangeably within this section without explicit
    clarification, which may cause uncertainty regarding the respective roles and responsibilities under GDPR. The
    Provider shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against
    unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss or destruction, consistent with Article 32 of the GDPR. In
    the event of a personal data breach, the Provider commits to notify the Customer without undue delay, though the
    definition of "undue delay" is not explicitly defined herein and may lead to differing expectations.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to cooperate fully to ensure compliance with GDPR obligations, including conducting data
    protection impact assessments if required. The Provider also reserves the right to modify its GDPR compliance
    measures as necessary to respond to regulatory developments, with notifications to the Customer provided within a
    reasonable timeframe, which is not rigidly defined, potentially leading to interpretive differences.</p>

<h3>Other Applicable Regulations</h3>
<p>In addition to the GDPR and CCPA, the Provider acknowledges that various other international, national, and
    sector-specific data protection regulations may apply to the processing activities under this Agreement. These may
    include, but are not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for health-related
    data in the United States, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada, and
    the Data Protection Act applicable in the United Kingdom. The Provider commits to making reasonable efforts to
    comply with such regulations where applicable; however, the scope and extent of compliance may vary depending on the
    jurisdiction and the nature of the data involved.</p>
<p>The Customer recognizes its responsibility to inform the Provider of any specific regulatory requirements that may
    impact data processing, including any industry-specific standards or contractual obligations. The Provider shall
    endeavor to accommodate such requirements to the extent technically feasible and consistent with its operational
    capabilities. Nevertheless, the Agreement does not explicitly define procedures for addressing conflicts between
    overlapping or contradictory legal requirements, which may result in interpretive uncertainty between the
    parties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably within this section, without clear distinction,
    which may cause ambiguity regarding the identification of the party responsible for compliance with certain
    regulatory provisions. Both parties agree to consult in good faith to clarify obligations arising from these other
    applicable regulations and to collaborate on any necessary adjustments to data processing practices.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is acknowledged that regulatory environments are subject to change, and the Provider reserves the right to
    modify its compliance measures accordingly. The Provider will attempt to notify the Customer of significant
    regulatory updates within a reasonable timeframe; however, the exact timing and method of such notifications are not
    strictly specified, potentially leading to differing expectations regarding communication.</p>

<h2>Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
<p>Data subjects whose personal information is processed through the Tool_3 platform retain certain rights under
    applicable data protection laws, including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to the
    processing of their personal data, as well as the right to data portability. The Customer, acting as the Data
    Controller, is primarily responsible for facilitating the exercise of these rights and for ensuring that requests
    from data subjects are handled in compliance with relevant legal requirements.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a data subject request, the Customer shall promptly notify the Provider to coordinate the appropriate
    actions necessary to fulfill the request. The Provider commits to assisting the Customer in responding to such
    requests within a reasonable timeframe, though the exact duration for fulfilling these obligations is not explicitly
    defined in this Agreement, potentially leading to differing expectations between the parties.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that certain rights, such as the right to erasure, may be subject to limitations imposed by the
    Provider’s internal retention policies or legal obligations, which could result in retention of data beyond the
    Customer’s or data subject’s deletion requests. This discrepancy introduces a potential conflict between the
    parties’ understanding of data subject rights enforcement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably in this section, which may cause
    slight ambiguity regarding the entity responsible for receiving and acting upon data subject requests. The Provider
    shall notify the Customer without undue delay of any direct data subject requests received where applicable, but the
    notification timing remains unspecified within this Agreement.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to ensure that data subject rights are respected and exercised
    effectively, with an understanding that certain procedural variances may arise due to operational constraints or
    regulatory differences. The Provider reserves the right to seek clarification from the Customer in cases of
    ambiguous or unclear data subject requests to ensure compliance and appropriate handling.</p>

<h3>Access and Portability</h3>
<p>The Provider acknowledges the rights of data subjects to access their personal data processed through the Tool_3
    platform and to receive such data in a portable format, consistent with applicable data protection laws. Upon
    receiving a valid access or portability request routed through the Customer, the Provider shall make reasonable
    efforts to provide the requested information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. The
    Provider will coordinate with the Customer to ensure that any data transferred directly to the data subject or
    another controller complies with legal requirements and safeguards the confidentiality of other Customer data.</p>
<p>Requests for data access or portability must be submitted by the Customer acting as the Data Controller, who bears
    responsibility for verifying the identity of the requesting data subject and ensuring the legitimacy of the request.
    The Provider shall respond to such requests within a reasonable period; however, the precise timeframe for
    compliance is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which may lead to differing expectations regarding the speed
    of response. Additionally, while this section refers primarily to the "Customer," the terms "User" and "Customer"
    continue to be used interchangeably elsewhere, potentially causing confusion over which entity is responsible for
    initiating or managing such requests.</p>
<p>The Provider reserves the right to withhold data access or portability if doing so would infringe upon the rights and
    freedoms of others or violate applicable laws. In scenarios where the Provider processes aggregated or anonymized
    data, the extent to which such data can be made portable or accessible is limited by the Provider’s discretion, as
    the data may no longer relate to identifiable individuals. This introduces some ambiguity regarding the scope of
    data subject rights as applied to various data categories within the platform.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to facilitate data access and portability requests in a manner that
    balances data subject rights, operational feasibility, and compliance with legal obligations. Any disputes or
    uncertainties regarding these processes shall be addressed through mutual consultation to reach an equitable
    resolution that upholds the principles of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Rectification and Erasure</h3>
<p>The Provider acknowledges the importance of ensuring the accuracy and completeness of Customer data processed through
    the Tool_3 platform. Upon receiving a valid request from the Customer, acting as the Data Controller, the Provider
    shall take reasonable steps to rectify any inaccuracies or incomplete data without undue delay. Requests for
    rectification must be communicated in writing and include sufficient detail to identify the data in question and the
    required corrections. However, the term “reasonable steps” is not explicitly defined herein, which may lead to
    differing interpretations regarding the scope and timeliness of corrective actions.</p>
<p>Regarding the erasure of data, the Provider commits to comply with deletion requests submitted by the Customer, to
    the extent that such requests do not conflict with the Provider’s internal retention policies or applicable legal
    obligations. It is acknowledged that certain data may be retained beyond the Customer’s deletion requests,
    particularly where retention is necessary for backup, archival, or regulatory compliance purposes. This may result
    in temporary data persistence despite the Customer’s expectations of prompt erasure, creating a potential
    inconsistency within the data lifecycle management.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while this section primarily refers to the “Customer” as the party entitled to request rectification or
    erasure, the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably throughout the Agreement, which could
    cause minor confusion as to the appropriate recipient of such requests. The Provider shall notify the Customer of
    the completion of rectification or erasure activities “without undue delay,” a phrase whose ambiguity remains
    unresolved within this Agreement.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to address any discrepancies or disputes arising from rectification or
    erasure requests and to document the actions taken. In cases where the Provider is unable to fulfill a request in
    full, the Provider will communicate the reasons to the Customer promptly and work towards a mutually acceptable
    resolution.</p>

<h3>Objections and Restrictions</h3>
<p>The Customer (also referred to as the User in some sections of this Agreement) retains the right to object to
    specific data processing activities conducted by the Provider under this Agreement, provided that such objections
    are reasonable and substantiated. Objection requests must be submitted in writing and include a clear explanation of
    the grounds for objection. The Provider shall review any such objections in good faith and respond within a
    reasonable timeframe, although the exact duration for response is not explicitly defined herein, potentially leading
    to differing expectations.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a valid objection, the Provider will evaluate whether the processing activity can be modified,
    restricted, or ceased without materially impairing the functionality or performance of the Tool_3 platform. However,
    the Provider reserves the right to continue processing data where it deems such activity necessary to comply with
    legal obligations, safeguard legitimate interests, or maintain essential operational capabilities. This may result
    in the Provider overriding certain Customer objections, which could create a conflict between the parties’
    interests.</p>
<p>Restrictions requested by the Customer shall be implemented promptly to the extent feasible, but the Provider’s
    internal policies and technical limitations may affect the timing and scope of such restrictions. Notably, the
    interchangeable use of “Customer” and “User” in this section can cause ambiguity concerning which party is
    authorized to submit objections or impose restrictions, especially in cases involving multi-tenant environments or
    delegated administration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider may impose reasonable restrictions on the Customer’s ability to object to processing
    activities that are critical to security, compliance, or the integrity of the Tool_3 platform. The parameters
    defining “reasonable restrictions” are not explicitly detailed in this Agreement, introducing potential uncertainty
    as to the limits of Customer control over data processing. Both parties agree to engage in good faith discussions to
    resolve any disputes arising from objections or restrictions, aiming to balance data protection rights with
    operational requirements.</p>

<h2>Audit and Monitoring</h2>
<p>The Provider shall maintain comprehensive audit logs and monitoring systems to ensure transparency and accountability
    of data processing activities performed under this Agreement. These audit logs shall record key events related to
    data access, modification, transfer, and deletion, enabling both the Provider and the Customer to verify compliance
    with applicable data protection standards and contractual obligations. The Provider commits to retaining such audit
    records for a period sufficient to support regulatory inquiries or dispute resolution, although the exact retention
    duration is subject to internal policy and not explicitly defined herein.</p>
<p>The Customer, acting as the Data Controller, reserves the right to conduct audits or inspections, either directly or
    through an appointed third party, to assess the Provider’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Such audits
    shall be conducted during normal business hours and upon providing reasonable prior notice to the Provider, which
    shall not be less than ten (10) business days. However, the term “reasonable prior notice” is not specifically
    quantified and may lead to differing interpretations between the parties. The Provider agrees to cooperate fully
    with such audits, granting access to relevant documentation, personnel, and premises as necessary to facilitate a
    thorough review.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider retains the right to limit audit scope and frequency to protect its
    proprietary information and minimize operational disruption. The Provider may also require that any third-party
    auditors engaged by the Customer sign confidentiality agreements consistent with the terms herein to safeguard
    sensitive information. It is noted that the terms “Customer” and “User” continue to be used inconsistently in this
    section, which may cause some uncertainty regarding the entity authorized to request audits or receive audit
    reports.</p>
<p>Monitoring of system performance and security events will be conducted continuously by the Provider to detect and
    respond to potential vulnerabilities or incidents. The results of such monitoring may be shared with the Customer
    periodically or upon request; however, the frequency and detail of these reports are not explicitly defined,
    potentially resulting in ambiguity about the level of transparency provided. Both parties agree to engage
    collaboratively to resolve any issues arising from audit findings or monitoring activities in a timely and
    constructive manner.</p>

<h3>Audit Rights</h3>
<p>The Customer, acting as the Data Controller, shall have the right to audit the Provider’s compliance with the terms
    of this Agreement, including the adequacy and effectiveness of technical and organizational measures implemented to
    protect Customer data. Audits may be conducted either directly by the Customer or through an independent third-party
    auditor appointed by the Customer, subject to the confidentiality obligations outlined herein. The Provider agrees
    to reasonably accommodate such audit requests, provided that the Customer furnishes at least ten (10) business days’
    prior written notice specifying the scope and objectives of the audit. However, the term “reasonably accommodate” is
    not explicitly defined, which may lead to differing expectations as to the extent of access or cooperation
    required.</p>
<p>Audits shall be limited to activities directly related to data processing under this Agreement and shall be conducted
    during normal business hours to minimize operational disruption. The Provider reserves the right to redact or
    withhold information that it deems proprietary or confidential, which may include certain security measures or
    internal processes, potentially creating tension between transparency and protection of trade secrets.</p>
<p>In the event that an audit reveals non-compliance or deficiencies in the Provider’s data protection practices, the
    Provider commits to promptly implement corrective actions in consultation with the Customer. Notwithstanding, the
    Provider may dispute audit findings if it believes they are based on incomplete or inaccurate information, and both
    parties agree to engage in good faith discussions to resolve such disagreements.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the terms “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably in this section and the
    broader Agreement, which might cause confusion regarding the party entitled to exercise audit rights, especially in
    scenarios involving delegated administration or third-party data controllers. The parties agree to clarify such
    ambiguities through mutual communication to ensure audit rights are exercised appropriately and effectively.</p>

<h3>Frequency and Scope of Audits</h3>
<p>The frequency and scope of audits conducted by the Customer, acting as the Data Controller, shall be mutually agreed
    upon by the parties, taking into consideration the nature of the processing activities, risk levels, and regulatory
    requirements. Generally, audits may be performed on an annual basis or more frequently if deemed necessary due to
    identified risks, regulatory changes, or security incidents. However, the Agreement does not specify a minimum or
    maximum number of audits permitted, which may lead to differing expectations regarding audit regularity.</p>
<p>Audit scope shall primarily focus on the Provider’s compliance with the technical and organizational measures
    described in this Agreement, including data security controls, processing activities, subprocessors’ adherence to
    contractual obligations, and incident response procedures. The Provider reserves the right to limit audit scope to
    areas directly related to the data processing under this Agreement to protect its proprietary information and
    operational integrity. Nonetheless, the extent to which audits may cover subprocessors or ancillary systems remains
    subject to negotiation, potentially causing ambiguity.</p>
<p>Requests for audit engagements must be submitted in writing by the Customer or User, as the terms are used
    interchangeably in this Agreement, which may create uncertainty about the authorized party to initiate audits. The
    Provider shall respond to such requests within a reasonable period, though this timeframe is not explicitly defined,
    possibly resulting in delays or misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Each audit shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner designed to minimize disruption to the
    Provider’s operations. The Provider will provide reasonable access to relevant personnel, documentation, and
    facilities necessary to facilitate the audit, subject to confidentiality constraints. Both parties agree to
    cooperate in good faith to resolve any issues arising from audit findings and to implement corrective actions
    promptly where required.</p>

<h2>Liability and Indemnification</h2>
<p>Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, each party shall be liable for damages arising from its
    respective breaches of obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to breaches of data protection
    requirements. The Provider’s total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether
    in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Customer during the twelve (12) months
    preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation applies notwithstanding any conflicting provisions
    elsewhere that may imply broader or narrower liability limits.</p>
<p>The Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Provider and its affiliates, officers, directors,
    employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable
    attorneys’ fees) arising out of or resulting from the Customer’s breach of data protection laws, failure to obtain
    necessary consents, or improper instructions provided to the Provider. Conversely, the Provider agrees to indemnify
    the Customer against third-party claims resulting from the Provider’s negligence or willful misconduct in processing
    Customer data in violation of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or
    punitive damages, including loss of profits or business interruption, even if advised of the possibility of such
    damages. The parties acknowledge that the term “Customer” and “User” are used inconsistently in this Agreement, and
    for purposes of liability and indemnification, any ambiguity shall be interpreted in favor of the Customer’s
    protections unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider’s indemnification obligations are contingent upon the Customer providing prompt written
    notice of any claim, granting reasonable cooperation, and allowing the Provider sole control over the defense and
    settlement of such claims. Failure to comply with these requirements may limit the Provider’s indemnification
    obligations. The extent of indemnification coverage and the procedures for its invocation may vary, as certain terms
    are not exhaustively defined herein, potentially leading to differing interpretations between the parties.</p>

<h3>Limitations of Liability</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither the Provider nor the Customer shall be liable to the other
    for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of
    profits, revenue, or business opportunities, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, even if such party
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The Provider’s total aggregate liability, whether in contract,
    tort, strict liability, or otherwise, shall not exceed the fees paid by the Customer to the Provider under this
    Agreement during the six (6) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, this limitation of liability shall not apply to damages resulting from the Provider’s
    gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breaches of confidentiality obligations. Furthermore, liability arising
    from data breaches or unauthorized access to Customer data shall be subject to the terms set forth in the Security
    Measures and Incident Response sections of this Agreement.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement; however,
    for the purposes of this section, any references to “Customer” shall be interpreted to include “User” unless
    explicitly stated otherwise. This inconsistent terminology may lead to ambiguity regarding which party’s liabilities
    are subject to these limitations in multi-tenant or delegated administration scenarios.</p>
<p>The parties agree that the limitations and exclusions of liability set forth herein represent a reasonable allocation
    of risk and that the fees charged reflect these limitations. The Provider disclaims any liability for loss or
    corruption of data resulting from actions by the Customer or third parties, except where such loss is directly
    caused by the Provider’s failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Indemnification Clauses</h3>
<p>Each party ("Indemnifying Party") agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party ("Indemnified
    Party"), including its officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages,
    liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to any
    third-party claim resulting from the Indemnifying Party’s breach of this Agreement, negligence, willful misconduct,
    or violation of applicable laws in connection with the performance of data processing activities under this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>The Customer shall indemnify the Provider against any claims arising from the Customer’s failure to obtain necessary
    consents from data subjects, provision of inaccurate or unlawful instructions, or violation of data protection laws.
    Conversely, the Provider shall indemnify the Customer for claims arising from breaches of security or unauthorized
    processing of Customer data caused by the Provider’s negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider’s indemnification obligations shall be contingent upon the Customer
    providing prompt written notice of any claim, granting reasonable cooperation, and allowing the Provider sole
    control over the defense and settlement of such claims. The Provider reserves the right to contest or settle claims
    at its discretion; however, any settlement requiring the Customer to admit liability or pay damages shall require
    the Customer’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the terms “User” and “Customer” are used inconsistently throughout this Agreement, and for
    the purposes of indemnification, such terminology shall be interpreted in favor of the Customer unless explicitly
    otherwise stated. Furthermore, while the Provider agrees to indemnify the Customer for certain claims, this
    obligation does not extend to indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, unless expressly specified elsewhere.
    The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to resolve disputes arising under this section, but the lack of a
    defined timeframe for notification or dispute resolution may lead to ambiguity regarding the enforcement of
    indemnification rights.</p>

<h2>Termination of Agreement</h2>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement upon providing written notice to the other party, subject to any minimum
    notice periods set forth in the relevant service agreements between the Provider and the Customer. Termination may
    occur for any reason, including but not limited to breach of contractual obligations, insolvency, or mutual
    agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate services
    immediately if it reasonably believes that the Customer or User has engaged in activities that compromise the
    security, integrity, or reputation of the Tool_3 platform.</p>
<p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Provider shall, subject to its internal retention policies,
    delete or anonymize Customer data in accordance with the data retention and deletion provisions set forth in Section
    6. It is acknowledged, however, that there may be conflicting interpretations regarding the timing of data deletion,
    as some sections stipulate immediate deletion while others allow for extended retention periods for backup and
    compliance purposes. The Customer is advised to consult with the Provider to clarify expectations and reconcile any
    discrepancies in this regard.</p>
<p>The Customer shall remain responsible for all fees and charges incurred up to the effective date of termination. Any
    outstanding payment obligations shall survive termination. Furthermore, termination of this Agreement shall not
    relieve either party of liabilities or obligations that arose prior to termination, including indemnification duties
    and confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to cooperate to ensure an orderly transition of services and data, to the extent reasonably
    practicable. The terms “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably in this section, which may create
    slight ambiguity as to the responsible party for initiating termination or managing post-termination activities. Any
    such ambiguity should be resolved by reference to the context of the respective contractual relationship.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Termination</h3>
<p>Termination of this Agreement may be initiated by either party upon the occurrence of certain conditions, including
    but not limited to material breach, insolvency, or failure to comply with applicable data protection laws. A
    material breach shall be deemed any violation of the obligations set forth in this Agreement that remains uncured
    for a period of thirty (30) days following written notice by the non-breaching party. However, the term “material
    breach” is not exhaustively defined herein, which may lead to differing interpretations regarding the severity of
    breaches warranting termination.</p>
<p>Additionally, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party engages in conduct that, in
    the reasonable opinion of the terminating party, jeopardizes the security, confidentiality, or operational integrity
    of the Tool_3 platform. Such conduct may include unauthorized data processing, repeated non-compliance with
    instructions, or actions that could result in regulatory sanctions.</p>
<p>Termination may also occur upon mutual written agreement between the Provider and the User or Customer. Notably, the
    use of “User” and “Customer” remains inconsistent in this section and throughout the Agreement, which may cause
    ambiguity about which entity holds termination rights or responsibilities. Furthermore, the Agreement does not
    specify the required form or recipient of termination notices, potentially leading to procedural uncertainties.</p>
<p>In cases of termination due to breach or non-compliance, the non-breaching party may exercise all available remedies
    under this Agreement or applicable law, including seeking injunctive relief or damages. The parties agree to
    cooperate in good faith to facilitate an orderly wind-down of services and data processing activities, although the
    exact process and timelines for such cooperation are not explicitly detailed, which could result in differing
    expectations or disputes.</p>

<h3>Post-Termination Obligations</h3>
<p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Provider shall continue to fulfill certain obligations as
    described herein to ensure the secure handling and disposition of Customer data. The Provider agrees to return or
    delete Customer data in accordance with the data retention and deletion provisions set forth in Section 6; however,
    as noted previously, the timing and scope of such deletion may be subject to the Provider’s internal retention
    policies, which could result in retention beyond the Customer’s expectations. This potential discrepancy highlights
    the need for both parties to engage in proactive communication to reconcile any conflicting interpretations.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider shall maintain confidentiality obligations with respect to all Customer
    data for a period of at least five (5) years following termination, regardless of whether data has been deleted or
    anonymized. This confidentiality commitment extends to any residual data retained for backup or compliance purposes.
    It is important to note that while the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably throughout this
    Agreement, this section primarily refers to the “Customer” as the party entitled to enforce post-termination rights
    and obligations, which may introduce some ambiguity in multi-tenant or delegated administration scenarios.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Provider shall cooperate with the Customer to facilitate an orderly transition of data and
    services, including providing reasonable assistance in exporting data or migrating to alternative platforms, subject
    to applicable fees and resource availability. Such cooperation shall be conducted within a timeframe deemed
    reasonable by the Provider, though this timeframe is not explicitly defined herein, potentially leading to differing
    expectations regarding the promptness of post-termination support.</p>
<p>Finally, any remaining fees or charges incurred up to the effective date of termination shall remain payable by the
    Customer. Both parties acknowledge that post-termination obligations are critical to ensuring compliance with data
    protection laws and maintaining the integrity of Customer data, and agree to act in good faith to resolve any
    disputes arising in this context.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Provider and the Customer (also referred to herein as
    the User) with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and
    understandings, whether written or oral. Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing
    and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. However, certain operational policies or procedures
    referenced herein may be updated unilaterally by the Provider, which could lead to inconsistencies between the
    Agreement and such policies if not promptly communicated.</p>
<p>The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any
    subsequent breach or default. Waivers must be explicitly stated in writing and signed by the waiving party.
    Notwithstanding this, the Agreement does not explicitly address the effect of partial waivers or the circumstances
    under which a waiver may be revoked, creating some ambiguity in enforcement.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from the Agreement without affecting the validity or enforceability of
    the remaining provisions. The parties shall endeavor in good faith to replace any invalid provision with a valid
    provision that closely reflects the original intent.</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the
    underlying service agreement between the Provider and the Customer. In the absence of such specification, the
    Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Provider’s principal place of business. The interchangeable use of
    “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement may cause minor uncertainty as to which entity is subject to the
    governing law in certain contexts.</p>
<p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control,
    including but not limited to acts of God, government actions, or system failures. In such events, the affected party
    shall notify the other party as soon as reasonably practicable. The Agreement does not define what constitutes
    “reasonable control,” thereby introducing potential ambiguity in force majeure claims.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the
    underlying service agreement between the Provider and the Customer. In the event that the underlying service
    agreement does not explicitly designate a governing law, this Agreement shall default to the laws of the Provider’s
    principal place of business. The parties acknowledge that the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User”
    within this Agreement may cause occasional ambiguity regarding which entity is subject to the governing legal
    framework in particular contexts.</p>
<p>Where applicable, the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the
    designated jurisdiction for the resolution of any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any jurisdiction to protect
    its intellectual property rights or confidential information without waiving any other rights or remedies under this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>In circumstances involving cross-border data transfers or multi-jurisdictional regulatory obligations, the governing
    law may not fully address all applicable legal requirements, potentially resulting in conflicts or uncertainties.
    The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to resolve any such issues in a manner that respects the intent and
    spirit of this Agreement. However, the Agreement does not specify explicit conflict-of-law rules or mechanisms for
    resolving these discrepancies, which may lead to differing interpretations or procedural disputes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any ambiguity arising from inconsistent terminology or undefined phrases—such as “reasonable control” or
    “reasonable timeframe”—within the context of governing law shall be interpreted in a manner that favors the
    enforceability of this Agreement and the protection of the Provider’s rights, unless otherwise mutually agreed. The
    parties acknowledge that this approach may result in varying interpretations, and agree to engage in good faith
    discussions to clarify such matters as necessary.</p>

<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its
    breach, termination, or validity, the parties shall first seek to resolve the matter amicably through good faith
    negotiations. Such negotiations shall commence within a reasonable period following written notice of the dispute by
    either the Provider or the Customer. However, the term “reasonable period” is not explicitly defined herein, which
    may lead to differing interpretations regarding the timing and duration of the negotiation phase.</p>
<p>If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) calendar days, either party
    may submit the dispute to mediation administered by a mutually agreed-upon mediator. Should the parties fail to
    agree on a mediator within fifteen (15) calendar days of a request for mediation, either party may unilaterally
    appoint a mediator. Mediation proceedings shall be conducted in the jurisdiction specified under the Governing Law
    section of this Agreement.</p>
<p>In the event that mediation does not resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) calendar days from the appointment of
    the mediator, either party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the arbitration
    institution agreed upon by the parties. Absent such agreement, the arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of
    the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The arbitration award shall be final and binding, and judgment upon the
    award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent
    jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights or confidential information without waiving the right to
    arbitrate other disputes. It is noted that this section predominantly refers to the “Customer” as the party entitled
    to initiate dispute resolution procedures; however, inconsistent use of “User” in other sections may create
    ambiguity about the party entitled to enforce these rights, which should be interpreted in context with the entire
    Agreement.</p>

<h3>Amendments and Modifications</h3>
<p>Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement shall be valid only if made in writing and signed by authorized
    representatives of both the Provider and the Customer. Verbal agreements or informal communications shall not be
    deemed binding unless subsequently confirmed in writing. The parties acknowledge that certain operational policies
    or procedures related to the Tool_3 platform may be updated unilaterally by the Provider; however, such changes
    shall be communicated to the User within a reasonable timeframe, the exact duration of which is not explicitly
    defined in this Agreement and therefore may lead to differing interpretations.</p>
<p>In cases where the Provider initiates modifications that materially affect the scope, nature, or security of data
    processing, the Provider will endeavor to notify the Customer in advance and provide an opportunity to review and
    discuss the proposed changes. Notwithstanding this, the Provider reserves the right to implement urgent amendments
    without prior notice if required to comply with applicable laws, regulatory requirements, or to address security
    vulnerabilities, which may result in limited consultation with the Customer or User.</p>
<p>The terms “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably throughout this section, which may cause
    ambiguity concerning which party must approve or acknowledge amendments. Both parties agree to act in good faith and
    cooperate to resolve any uncertainties arising from such inconsistencies. Failure to object in writing to any
    amendment within thirty (30) days of receipt shall be deemed acceptance by the receiving party, unless otherwise
    stipulated in the applicable service agreement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any amendments that conflict with other provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner
    that seeks to harmonize the parties’ intentions. To the extent that an amendment is found to be invalid or
    unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in
    good faith to replace any invalid amendments with valid terms that closely reflect the original intent.</p>
