<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Terms of Service ("Terms") governing your use of Tool_3, an advanced AI-driven analytics platform
    designed to empower data analysts by providing intuitive visualizations and predictive modeling capabilities. These
    Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you, referred to herein as either the "User" or the "Customer,"
    and the provider of Tool_3. By accessing or using the platform, you agree to comply with and be bound by these
    Terms.</p>
<p>Tool_3 is intended exclusively for use by professional data analysts who require sophisticated tools to analyze
    complex datasets. The platform offers a broad range of services, including data ingestion, transformation, and
    advanced predictive analytics. Please note that while we strive to ensure continuous availability of the platform,
    maintenance periods or unforeseen outages may affect your access without prior notice.</p>
<p>These Terms outline your rights and responsibilities as a User, along with the provider's obligations. If you do not
    agree to any part of these Terms, you should not use Tool_3. The provider reserves the right to modify or update
    these Terms at any time, with changes becoming effective immediately upon posting. It is your responsibility to
    review the Terms periodically; continued use of the platform after modifications shall constitute acceptance of the
    new Terms.</p>
<p>For the purposes of data retention, the provider may retain your data indefinitely unless explicitly requested to
    delete it. However, under certain circumstances, data may be deleted after a reasonable period, which will be
    determined at the provider's discretion.</p>

<h3>Purpose of Agreement</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms and conditions under which the Customer may access
    and use Tool_3, the AI Analytics platform provided by the Company. This Agreement sets forth the mutual
    understanding between the parties regarding the scope of permitted usage, intellectual property rights, data
    handling practices, and limitations of liability.</p>
<p>Tool_3 is designed to facilitate the analysis of complex datasets through advanced AI-driven analytics, including but
    not limited to data visualization, predictive modeling, and data transformation services. By entering into this
    Agreement, the User acknowledges that the platform is intended solely for professional data analysts and agrees to
    use the services strictly in accordance with these Terms. Any unauthorized use outside the scope of professional
    data analysis is prohibited and may result in termination of access.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this Agreement outlines the responsibilities of both the provider and the Customer in regard to data
    security, confidentiality, and compliance with applicable laws. The Company commits to maintaining reasonable
    safeguards to protect the Customer's data but disclaims any liability for data loss or unauthorized access except as
    expressly stated herein.</p>
<p>It is understood that the terms "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably throughout this document, referring to
    the individual or entity utilizing Tool_3. The Agreement also clarifies that while the Company may retain data
    indefinitely, deletion requests will be processed within a reasonable time frame, although "reasonable" is not
    specifically defined and may vary case by case.</p>

<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>By accessing or using Tool_3, the User hereby acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by
    all provisions set forth in these Terms of Service. The act of utilizing any feature or service offered by Tool_3
    constitutes explicit acceptance of these Terms, including any future amendments or updates that may be implemented
    by the Company. Should the Customer disagree with any part of these Terms, they must immediately cease using the
    platform and notify the provider.</p>
<p>The User further agrees that continued use of Tool_3 after modifications to the Terms have been posted on the
    Company’s website shall be deemed acceptance of those changes, even if the User has not been directly notified. The
    Company reserves the right to enforce these Terms at its sole discretion, including suspension or termination of
    access without prior notice, if it determines that the User has violated any provision herein.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may occasionally require Users to affirmatively accept updated Terms
    through an electronic prompt or other mechanism prior to continuing access. Failure to complete such affirmation may
    result in restricted functionality or temporary suspension until acceptance is obtained.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement.
    However, in some instances, "User" may refer specifically to individual accounts, whereas "Customer" may imply the
    legal entity responsible for payment and compliance. This distinction may affect certain rights and obligations, and
    Users are advised to review their account settings and agreements carefully. In case of any inconsistency or
    ambiguity between these terms, the Company’s interpretation shall prevail.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below unless the context
    otherwise requires:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>"User"</strong> means any individual or entity that accesses or uses Tool_3, including but not limited
        to employees, contractors, or agents authorized by the Customer. The term may refer to both individual account
        holders and organizational representatives.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Customer"</strong> refers to the legal entity or individual that subscribes to or purchases access to
        Tool_3 and is responsible for payment and compliance with these Terms. In certain contexts, "Customer" and
        "User" may be used interchangeably; however, the distinction is maintained for clarity of obligations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Company"</strong> indicates the provider and operator of Tool_3, responsible for maintaining the
        platform and enforcing these Terms.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Data"</strong> encompasses all information, datasets, and content uploaded, processed, or generated
        through Tool_3 by the User or Customer. This includes raw data, transformed data, analytical outputs, and
        visualizations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Service"</strong> refers collectively to all functionalities offered by Tool_3, including data
        ingestion, transformation, predictive modeling, and visualization tools.
    </li>
    <li><strong>"Reasonable Period"</strong> means a timeframe for action or response that is fair and appropriate under
        the circumstances, but this period is not specifically defined herein and may vary based on the Company’s
        discretion and operational considerations.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that while the terms "User" and "Customer" are often used synonymously, any conflicting
    interpretation shall default to the Company's understanding, which may not necessarily align with the Customer's
    expectations. Additionally, the use of "reasonable period" introduces ambiguity regarding timelines for data
    deletion and other obligations, potentially impacting Users' ability to anticipate service responses.</p>

<h2>Scope of Services</h2>
<p>The Company agrees to provide the Customer with access to Tool_3’s suite of AI-driven analytics services, which
    include but are not limited to data ingestion, transformation, visualization, and predictive modeling
    functionalities. These services are designed to enable data analysts to derive actionable insights from complex
    datasets through an intuitive interface and advanced algorithms. However, the extent of available features may vary
    depending on the subscription plan selected by the User, and certain advanced capabilities might be subject to
    additional fees or separate agreements.</p>
<p>Tool_3’s Service availability is generally provided on a continuous basis, except during scheduled maintenance
    windows or unexpected disruptions, which the Company may impose without prior notice. While the Company endeavors to
    minimize downtime, it disclaims any liability for service interruptions or data loss arising from such events.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges that the Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the
    analytical outputs generated through the platform. All results produced by the Service are provided "as is" and
    should be independently validated by the User before making business decisions based thereon.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at its sole discretion, limit or suspend specific features for
    certain Users or Customers without prior notice if usage is deemed to contravene these Terms or applicable laws.
    Furthermore, it is understood that the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used inconsistently in communications
    related to Service access, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding which party holds responsibility for certain
    actions or compliance matters.</p>
<p>Finally, while the Service facilitates data processing and analysis, the Company does not assume responsibility for
    the underlying data quality or integrity provided by the Customer. The Customer remains solely responsible for
    ensuring that all data uploaded to Tool_3 complies with relevant legal and regulatory standards.</p>

<h3>Description of Tool_3 Features</h3>
<p>Tool_3 offers a comprehensive set of features designed to assist data analysts in extracting meaningful insights from
    complex datasets. These features include advanced data ingestion capabilities that support a wide variety of data
    formats and sources, enabling seamless integration with existing data infrastructures. The platform also provides
    robust data transformation tools, allowing Users to cleanse, normalize, and prepare data for analysis.</p>
<p>Central to Tool_3’s functionality are its AI-driven predictive modeling algorithms, which utilize machine learning
    techniques to forecast trends and identify patterns. These predictive models can be customized by the Customer to
    suit specific analytical needs, subject to the limits imposed by their subscription plan. Additionally, Tool_3
    offers interactive visualization dashboards that facilitate intuitive exploration and presentation of analytical
    results.</p>
<p>While the features described herein represent the core offerings of Tool_3, the Company reserves the right to modify,
    enhance, or discontinue any feature at its sole discretion without prior notification to the User. It is important
    to note that certain features may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance or technical issues, and the Company
    disclaims liability for any impact this may have on the Customer's workflows.</p>
<p>The terms "User" and "Customer" are occasionally used interchangeably in describing feature access, which may create
    uncertainty regarding eligibility or feature entitlements—particularly in multi-user organizational accounts where
    individual Users may have varying permissions. Furthermore, the Company does not warrant that all features will
    operate flawlessly or without interruption, and the platform is provided “as is” without guarantees of uninterrupted
    access or error-free performance.</p>

<h3>Service Availability</h3>
<p>The Company endeavors to ensure that Tool_3 is available to the User and Customer on a 24/7 basis, subject to
    scheduled maintenance and unforeseen outages. Maintenance windows will generally be communicated in advance via
    email or notifications through the platform, although the Company reserves the right to perform emergency
    maintenance without prior notice when deemed necessary to protect the integrity or security of the Service. During
    such periods, access to certain features or the entire platform may be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>While the Company strives to minimize downtime, it does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free access to Tool_3.
    The Service is provided “as is” and “as available,” and the Company expressly disclaims any liability for
    interruptions, delays, or failures in service availability, regardless of whether such failures arise from scheduled
    maintenance, technical issues, or external factors beyond the Company’s control.</p>
<p>In some instances, the terms "User" and "Customer" are used inconsistently when referring to who may experience or
    report service interruptions, which may lead to confusion in determining responsibility for notifying the Company or
    addressing service issues. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that Users within their organization are
    informed of any disruptions and to coordinate communication with the Company as necessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Company may impose limits or restrictions on Service availability or feature access based on the
    Customer’s subscription level, payment status, or compliance with these Terms. Such limitations may not always be
    explicitly communicated and could result in partial or full suspension of access. It is recommended that Customers
    regularly review their account status and maintain up-to-date contact information to mitigate the impact of any
    service availability issues.</p>
<p>Finally, the Company does not commit to any specific uptime percentage or service level agreement (SLA) within these
    Terms, and the definition of a “reasonable period” for restoring Service following an outage remains undefined,
    potentially affecting the User’s expectations and planning.</p>

<h3>Limitations and Restrictions</h3>
<p>The User and Customer acknowledge and agree that access to and use of Tool_3 is subject to certain limitations and
    restrictions as set forth herein. The Company reserves the right to impose usage caps, feature restrictions, or
    other controls on the Service to ensure system integrity, prevent abuse, and comply with applicable laws and
    regulations. Such limitations may vary by subscription tier and may be modified at the Company’s discretion without
    prior notice.</p>
<p>Users shall not use Tool_3 to upload, transmit, or disseminate any data or content that is unlawful, harmful,
    defamatory, infringing, or otherwise objectionable. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that all data provided
    complies with these restrictions. The Company may suspend or terminate access to the Service immediately upon
    detecting any violation, without prior warning. However, in some cases, the Company may allow continued use while
    investigating suspected breaches, which may cause uncertainty regarding enforcement timelines.</p>
<p>Further, the User agrees not to reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code or underlying
    algorithms of Tool_3, except as expressly permitted by law. The Company disclaims any liability arising from
    unauthorized attempts to modify or circumvent platform controls.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while the terms "User" and "Customer" are generally used interchangeably, certain
    restrictions may apply specifically to the Customer as the contracting party, such as payment obligations and
    compliance with export controls. This distinction is not always explicitly delineated within these Terms,
    potentially leading to ambiguity about which party bears responsibility for certain breaches or penalties.</p>
<p>Finally, the Company does not guarantee that all restrictions will be uniformly enforced or that the Service will be
    free from unauthorized use by third parties. Users are encouraged to report any suspected misuse, but the Company’s
    liability in such cases remains limited as detailed in the Limitation of Liability section.</p>

<h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>As a condition of continued access to and use of Tool_3, the User and Customer shall adhere to all responsibilities
    set forth herein. The User is obligated to provide accurate, complete, and lawful data for processing through the
    Service. The Customer remains responsible for the supervision and management of all authorized Users under its
    account, including ensuring compliance with these Terms and any applicable laws. Failure to monitor User activity or
    enforce internal policies may result in suspension or termination of access at the sole discretion of the
    Company.</p>
<p>The User agrees to maintain the confidentiality of their login credentials and promptly notify the Company of any
    unauthorized use or security breach related to their account. Negligence in safeguarding access information may lead
    to liability for any resulting damages or misuse. Additionally, Users must ensure that their use of Tool_3 does not
    interfere with or disrupt the functionality or security of the platform, including refraining from attempts to
    bypass usage restrictions or reverse engineering, as outlined in the Limitations and Restrictions section.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon the Customer to keep billing and contact information current and to fulfill all payment
    obligations in a timely manner. The Company reserves the right to restrict or suspend Service access if payment is
    overdue, although the specific timeline and notification procedures for such actions are not expressly detailed in
    these Terms, creating some uncertainty regarding enforcement.</p>
<p>Moreover, Users should regularly back up any data or analytical results derived from Tool_3, as the Company disclaims
    responsibility for data loss or corruption, even though in the Introduction it was noted that data may be retained
    indefinitely. This apparent contradiction regarding data retention policies underscores the importance of Users
    maintaining independent data copies.</p>
<p>Finally, the User and Customer acknowledge that adherence to these responsibilities is critical to maintaining
    Service integrity and compliance. The Company may audit accounts and usage patterns to verify compliance but is not
    obligated to provide advance notice of such audits. Noncompliance may result in suspension, termination, or legal
    action as deemed appropriate by the Company.</p>

<h3>Account Registration and Security</h3>
<p>To access and utilize Tool_3, the User or Customer must complete the account registration process by providing
    accurate, current, and complete information as requested by the Company. The Customer is responsible for ensuring
    that all details submitted during registration, including but not limited to contact information, billing details,
    and authorized Users, remain up-to-date throughout the term of service. Failure to maintain accurate information may
    result in suspension or termination of the account without prior notice.</p>
<p>Each registered account is issued unique login credentials, which the User must safeguard and use solely in
    accordance with these Terms. The Company expressly disclaims liability for any unauthorized access or damage arising
    from the User's failure to protect their credentials or from sharing login information with third parties. In the
    event of a suspected security breach or compromise, the User agrees to notify the Company immediately to mitigate
    potential damages.</p>
<p>Account access is limited to the registered User or Users designated by the Customer; however, the Terms do not
    clearly distinguish the obligations or rights of individual Users versus the Customer as the subscribing entity,
    which may lead to ambiguity regarding accountability in multi-user environments. The Company reserves the right to
    suspend or terminate accounts that exhibit suspicious or unauthorized activity, though the criteria and procedures
    for such actions are not fully detailed herein.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the Company requires Users to select strong passwords during registration, the definition of
    "strong" is not explicitly provided, introducing some uncertainty about minimum security standards. Users are
    encouraged to change their passwords periodically and to follow best practices for account security.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that, although the platform supports multi-user accounts, the Company may treat the Customer as
    the sole party responsible for all activities under the account, regardless of which individual User performed them.
    This may create potential conflicts in accountability, especially in larger organizations with multiple authorized
    Users.</p>

<h3>Compliance with Applicable Laws</h3>
<p>The User and Customer agree to comply with all applicable local, national, and international laws, regulations, and
    ordinances in connection with their use of Tool_3. This includes, but is not limited to, data protection laws,
    export control regulations, intellectual property rights, and anti-corruption statutes. The Company expects that all
    data uploaded, processed, or analyzed through the Service shall adhere to these legal requirements, and the Customer
    bears sole responsibility for ensuring such compliance.</p>
<p>The Company shall not be held liable for any violations of laws resulting from the User's or Customer's misuse of the
    platform or improper handling of data. Moreover, the Customer agrees to promptly notify the Company if it becomes
    aware of any suspected or actual non-compliance related to the use of Tool_3.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Terms use "User" and "Customer" interchangeably in this section, although in some
    contexts, the Customer, as the contracting party, may bear greater legal obligations. This inconsistent terminology
    may cause uncertainty regarding which party is accountable for compliance in multi-user environments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the Company endeavors to maintain the platform in accordance with relevant legal standards, it
    makes no guarantees that the Service itself complies with every jurisdictional requirement applicable to the
    Customer's specific use cases. It remains the Customer’s duty to verify that their use of Tool_3 adheres to all
    applicable laws.</p>
<p>Finally, any requests for data deletion or export necessitated by legal obligations will be handled by the Company
    within a reasonable period; however, the exact timeframe for such actions is not explicitly defined, which may
    impact the Customer’s ability to meet time-sensitive regulatory deadlines. Users are advised to plan accordingly and
    seek independent legal counsel as necessary.</p>

<h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
<p>Users and Customers are strictly prohibited from engaging in any activities that violate these Terms or applicable
    laws while using Tool_3. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Uploading, transmitting, or distributing any data or content that is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, infringing
        on intellectual property rights, or otherwise objectionable;
    </li>
    <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other User accounts, or Company systems, including
        through hacking, phishing, or any form of cyberattack;
    </li>
    <li>Interfering with the normal operation of Tool_3, including introducing viruses, malware, or other harmful
        code;
    </li>
    <li>Reverse engineering, decompiling, or otherwise attempting to extract the source code or proprietary algorithms
        of Tool_3 beyond what is expressly permitted by law;
    </li>
    <li>Using the Service to engage in any fraudulent, deceptive, or malicious activities;</li>
    <li>Circumventing or attempting to bypass any usage restrictions, access controls, or subscription limits imposed by
        the Company;
    </li>
    <li>Using Tool_3 to process data in violation of any data protection laws or regulations applicable to the Customer
        or User.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The Company reserves the right to investigate any suspected violations of these prohibitions and may suspend,
    restrict, or terminate access to Tool_3 at its sole discretion, with or without prior notice. Notwithstanding this,
    in some circumstances, the Company may allow continued access during the investigation period, which may create
    uncertainty regarding enforcement timelines and the status of the User’s account.</p>
<p>It is important to note that references to "User" and "Customer" within this section may be used interchangeably or
    inconsistently, potentially creating ambiguity as to which party is responsible for compliance with these
    prohibitions. The Company’s interpretation will govern in cases of conflict.</p>

<h2>Fees and Payment Terms</h2>
<p>The Customer agrees to pay all fees and charges specified in the applicable subscription plan or service agreement
    associated with their use of Tool_3. Payment obligations arise upon activation of the Service and continue for the
    duration of the subscription period, unless otherwise terminated in accordance with these Terms. Fees may include,
    but are not limited to, subscription charges, usage-based fees, taxes, and any applicable surcharges.</p>
<p>All payments shall be made in the currency indicated on the invoice and are due within thirty (30) days of the
    invoice date unless a different payment schedule is expressly agreed upon by the Company and the Customer. The
    Company reserves the right to suspend or restrict access to Tool_3 for any Customer whose account remains delinquent
    beyond a reasonable period, although the definition of "reasonable period" is not explicitly set forth herein,
    potentially leading to uncertainty regarding timing of service interruptions.</p>
<p>Invoices will be issued electronically to the designated billing contact provided during account registration. It is
    the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that billing information is accurate and up to date. Failure to receive
    an invoice does not relieve the Customer from their payment obligations. Late payments may be subject to interest
    charges at a rate determined by the Company, but the exact rate is not specified in these Terms.</p>
<p>Discounts, promotions, or special pricing may be offered at the Company’s discretion and are subject to specific
    terms that may differ from the standard fee structure. Any such arrangements must be documented in writing to be
    enforceable. In cases where the Customer disputes a charge, notification must be provided within fifteen (15) days
    of the invoice date; otherwise, the charge shall be deemed accepted.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the terms "User" and "Customer" may sometimes be used interchangeably in billing
    communications, which could cause confusion especially in organizational accounts where multiple Users operate under
    a single Customer entity. The Company holds the Customer ultimately responsible for all fees incurred under their
    account regardless of which User initiated the charges.</p>

<h3>Subscription Plans</h3>
<p>The use of Tool_3 is governed by various subscription plans, each offering differing levels of access to features,
    data processing capacity, and user seats. The Customer acknowledges that subscription plans may include but are not
    limited to Basic, Professional, and Enterprise tiers, with specific entitlements and limitations described in the
    applicable service agreement or order form.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to modify subscription plans, including pricing, feature availability, and usage
    limits, at any time upon providing notice to the Customer. Such modifications may take effect immediately or after a
    notice period, which is not consistently defined across communications, potentially causing ambiguity regarding the
    timing of plan changes.</p>
<p>Subscription fees are billed in advance based on the selected plan and payment frequency, which may be monthly,
    quarterly, or annually. Upgrades or downgrades between plans are subject to Company approval and may result in
    prorated fees or adjustments. However, no explicit policy governs refunds or credits for plan changes, which may
    lead to uncertainty for the Customer.</p>
<p>Access to certain advanced features or higher data volumes may be restricted to specific subscription levels. While
    the term “User” generally refers to individual account holders, in the context of subscription plans, “Customer” is
    used to denote the paying entity; this inconsistent terminology may create confusion about who is authorized to
    modify or manage the subscription. Additionally, the Company may impose limits on the number of active Users under a
    given plan, but the enforcement mechanisms are not thoroughly detailed herein.</p>
<p>The Company may, at its discretion, offer trial periods or promotional access to Tool_3 services. Terms governing
    such trials are subject to separate agreements and may include automatic conversion to paid subscriptions unless
    cancelled within a specified timeframe, though the exact duration and cancellation procedures are not uniformly
    disclosed.</p>

<h3>Billing and Payment Methods</h3>
<p>The Company accepts payment for Tool_3 services through various methods, including major credit cards, bank
    transfers, and authorized third-party payment processors. The Customer is responsible for providing valid and
    current payment information during registration and maintaining such information throughout the subscription period.
    Failure to update expired or invalid payment details may result in suspension or termination of Service access
    without prior notice.</p>
<p>Invoices for subscription fees and any applicable charges will be generated and delivered electronically to the
    billing contact designated by the Customer. It is the Customer’s obligation to ensure that this contact information
    is accurate and regularly monitored. The Company shall not be held liable for any delays or non-receipt of invoices
    due to incorrect billing details. Payment terms specify that amounts due must be settled within thirty (30) days of
    the invoice date unless otherwise stipulated in a separate agreement.</p>
<p>While the term “Customer” is primarily used to denote the paying entity, billing communications may occasionally
    refer to the “User,” which could create confusion in cases where multiple Users operate under a single Customer
    account. The Company holds the Customer ultimately liable for all charges incurred, regardless of which User
    initiated the transaction.</p>
<p>Payments made via credit card or authorized processors will be charged automatically according to the billing cycle
    selected at subscription commencement. Bank transfers require the Customer to initiate payment proactively and
    provide remittance details to facilitate accurate application of funds. Any discrepancies or disputes regarding
    invoices must be submitted in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt. Failure to dispute charges within this
    timeframe will be deemed acceptance of the invoice as accurate.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to modify accepted payment methods at any time, with or without prior notice.
    Additionally, while the Company strives to ensure secure processing of payments, it disclaims liability for any
    issues arising from third-party payment systems. Customers are encouraged to review their payment method settings
    regularly to avoid unintended service interruptions.</p>

<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<p>The Company aims to provide high-quality services through Tool_3 and strives to ensure Customer satisfaction.
    However, all payments made under these Terms are generally non-refundable unless otherwise expressly stated in a
    separate written agreement. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that subscription fees, usage charges, and any
    other payments made are final and not subject to refund, credit, or adjustment except in cases where the Company
    determines, in its sole discretion, that a refund is warranted due to billing errors or service failures.</p>
<p>Requests for refunds must be submitted in writing to the Company’s billing department within thirty (30) days of the
    charge in question. Refunds, if approved, will be processed using the original payment method within a reasonable
    period, although the specific timeframe for processing refunds is not defined in these Terms and may vary depending
    on payment processor policies. The lack of a clear refund timeline may result in delays that the Customer should
    anticipate.</p>
<p>In the event of service suspension or termination initiated by the Company for violations of these Terms, including
    but not limited to prohibited activities or non-payment, the Customer shall not be entitled to any refund for the
    unused portion of the subscription term. Conversely, if the Company suspends or restricts access to Tool_3 due to
    technical issues or maintenance, no refunds or credits will be provided unless explicitly agreed upon in writing.
    This may conflict with earlier provisions suggesting data retention and service continuity, creating ambiguity
    regarding compensation for service disruptions.</p>
<p>Trial periods or promotional access to Tool_3 services may include separate refund or cancellation conditions, which
    will be communicated at the time of offer. Customers are advised to carefully review those terms, as failure to
    cancel within the specified period may result in automatic billing without entitlement to refund. Additionally, the
    inconsistent use of "User" and "Customer" in billing and refund contexts may cause confusion about who is eligible
    to request refunds, and the Company’s interpretation shall prevail in such cases.</p>

<h2>Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
<p>The Company is committed to protecting the privacy and security of data processed through Tool_3. The User and
    Customer acknowledge that all Data uploaded, stored, or analyzed via the Service remains the property of the
    Customer, and the Company acts solely as a data processor under these Terms. The Company shall implement
    commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard Data against unauthorized access,
    disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, the Company does not guarantee absolute security and disclaims
    liability for breaches resulting from factors beyond its control.</p>
<p>Data retention practices are governed by the provisions set forth herein, which state that the Company may retain
    User or Customer Data indefinitely unless a deletion request is submitted. In contrast, elsewhere it is indicated
    that Data may be deleted after a “reasonable period,” a term that is not explicitly defined and may vary depending
    on operational considerations. This ambiguity may affect the Customer’s ability to manage Data lifecycle
    expectations effectively.</p>
<p>The Company may collect certain personal information from Users and Customers in accordance with its Privacy Policy,
    which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. Users are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy to understand
    how personal data is handled, including information collected, processing purposes, and data sharing practices.
    Notwithstanding, the Terms occasionally use "User" and "Customer" interchangeably in this context, potentially
    causing uncertainty regarding which party’s personal data policies apply in multi-user or organizational
    scenarios.</p>
<p>Customers are responsible for ensuring that all Data uploaded to Tool_3 complies with applicable data protection laws
    and that any necessary consents or authorizations have been obtained. The Company will cooperate with lawful
    requests from regulatory authorities concerning Data but is not liable for compliance failures attributable to the
    Customer’s actions or omissions. Furthermore, in cases where Data deletion or export is requested for regulatory
    compliance, the Company will process such requests within a reasonable timeframe, although this timeframe is not
    clearly defined in these Terms.</p>

<h3>Data Collection and Usage</h3>
<p>The Company collects various types of Data from the User and Customer during the course of providing the Tool_3
    Service. This Data includes, but is not limited to, raw datasets uploaded to the platform, metadata generated
    through usage, and analytical outputs derived from processing activities. The Company uses this Data primarily to
    enable and improve the functionality of Tool_3, including enhancing predictive models, optimizing platform
    performance, and tailoring user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to operational uses, the Company may aggregate anonymized Data for internal research and development
    purposes or to produce industry insights. Notwithstanding, the Company does not claim ownership over User or
    Customer Data, which remains the sole property of the respective Customer. However, the Terms sometimes refer
    interchangeably to Users and Customers in data rights contexts, which may cause uncertainty about permissions,
    especially in multi-user organizational accounts.</p>
<p>Data collection may also involve automated processes such as logging usage patterns and system diagnostics. While
    these practices help maintain service quality and security, the exact scope and retention period for such data are
    not explicitly defined herein, introducing ambiguity around data lifecycle management. Furthermore, although the
    Company commits to processing Data in accordance with applicable privacy laws, it reserves the right to use User
    Data for improving Service features without prior individual consent, unless prohibited by law.</p>
<p>The Company may share Data with third-party service providers solely to the extent necessary to deliver or support
    Tool_3 features, under confidentiality agreements designed to protect Data integrity and confidentiality. Users and
    Customers acknowledge and accept this practice as part of the Service. In contrast, the Terms elsewhere state that
    Data deletion requests will be honored within a “reasonable period,” a term which remains undefined and may affect
    User expectations concerning data removal and third-party disclosures.</p>

<h3>User Data Rights</h3>
<p>The User and Customer retain certain rights regarding the Data they upload, process, and generate through Tool_3.
    Subject to applicable laws and these Terms, the Company acknowledges the Customer's ownership of all Data and
    commits to facilitating reasonable requests related to Data access, correction, deletion, and portability. However,
    the specific processes and timelines for exercising these rights may vary and are not exhaustively detailed herein,
    which may result in some ambiguity regarding Customer expectations.</p>
<p>Users may request access to their Data or seek corrections to inaccurate or incomplete information by contacting the
    Company through designated support channels. While the Company endeavors to respond to such requests within a
    reasonable period, this timeframe is not explicitly defined and may fluctuate based on the nature and volume of
    requests. Furthermore, deletion requests submitted by Users or Customers will be processed in accordance with the
    Company’s data retention policies; however, as noted elsewhere, Data may be retained indefinitely unless a deletion
    request is made. This creates a potential conflict regarding the duration that Data is actually retained.</p>
<p>In addition, the Customer may request Data portability in a commonly used and machine-readable format. The Company
    will provide such Data to the extent technically feasible, but does not guarantee compatibility with all third-party
    systems or that all Data elements can be exported without loss or alteration.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the terms "User" and "Customer" are sometimes used interchangeably in this section,
    despite potentially differing rights or roles in multi-user organizational accounts. This inconsistency may cause
    confusion regarding who is entitled to exercise specific Data rights. The Company’s interpretation shall govern in
    the event of any dispute.</p>
<p>Finally, the Company reserves the right to deny Data requests that conflict with legal obligations, security
    concerns, or contractual commitments. In such cases, the Company will provide a rationale for denial to the
    requesting party where legally permissible.</p>

<h3>Security Measures</h3>
<p>The Company implements a variety of security measures designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and
    availability of Data processed through Tool_3. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption of Data at
    rest and in transit, multi-factor authentication options for account access, regular security audits, and intrusion
    detection systems. The Company also maintains physical security controls at its data centers and employs
    industry-standard practices to safeguard against unauthorized access or cyber threats.</p>
<p>While the Company strives to maintain a secure environment, it does not guarantee absolute protection against all
    potential vulnerabilities or attacks. Users and Customers acknowledge that no system can be entirely impervious to
    breaches, and the Company disclaims liability for damages resulting from unauthorized access or security incidents
    beyond its reasonable control.</p>
<p>The User and Customer share responsibility for maintaining the security of their own accounts, including safeguarding
    login credentials and promptly reporting suspected security breaches. Failure to comply with such responsibilities
    may impact the effectiveness of the Company’s protective measures and could result in suspension or termination of
    access.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that, in certain communications, the terms "User" and "Customer" are used inconsistently within
    this section, which may create ambiguity regarding which party is responsible for specific security obligations.
    Additionally, while the Company commits to notify Users of significant security incidents within a reasonable
    timeframe, the term "reasonable timeframe" is not explicitly defined, potentially leading to variable expectations
    about the promptness of such notifications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Company reserves the right to update or modify its security protocols at any time without prior
    notice to the User or Customer to address emerging threats or compliance requirements. Such updates may temporarily
    affect Service availability or functionality, and the Company disclaims liability for any disruptions arising from
    security updates or enforcement actions.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and
    proprietary technologies embodied in Tool_3 and its underlying software, algorithms, and documentation are
    exclusively owned by the Company or its licensors. The User and Customer acknowledge that no title or ownership in
    the Service or associated intellectual property is transferred to them under these Terms. The Company grants only a
    limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Service strictly in accordance with these
    Terms.</p>
<p>The Customer shall not, and shall ensure that all Users do not, copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer,
    decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on Tool_3 or any part thereof, except to the extent
    expressly permitted by applicable law or with the Company’s prior written consent. Unauthorized use or exploitation
    of the Company’s intellectual property may result in immediate suspension or termination of access, as well as legal
    action.</p>
<p>All Data uploaded or generated by the User or Customer remains the sole property of the Customer; however, by using
    the Service, the Customer grants the Company a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, and
    process such Data solely for the purpose of providing and improving Tool_3. This license terminates upon deletion of
    the Data or termination of the Agreement, unless otherwise required by law or contractual obligations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in certain sections of these Terms, the terms "User" and "Customer" are used
    interchangeably with regard to intellectual property rights and obligations, which may cause ambiguity in multi-user
    organizational accounts regarding who holds specific rights or responsibilities. The Company’s interpretation shall
    prevail in the event of any conflict.</p>
<p>Finally, the Company reserves the right to enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent permitted
    by law, including seeking injunctive relief and damages for infringement. Users and Customers agree to cooperate
    with the Company in protecting its intellectual property and promptly report any suspected violations or
    unauthorized use.</p>

<h3>Ownership of Content</h3>
<p>All content, materials, and data uploaded, generated, or otherwise provided by the User or Customer through the use
    of Tool_3 ("Content") shall remain the exclusive property of the Customer. The Company acknowledges that it holds no
    ownership rights in such Content beyond the limited license granted for the purpose of delivering and improving the
    Service as described in the Intellectual Property section.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to use aggregated, anonymized Content derived from
    multiple Customers for internal analytics, benchmarking, and product development. Such use shall not identify
    individual Users or Customers and does not confer any ownership interest in the underlying Content to the
    Company.</p>
<p>It is understood that the Customer is responsible for ensuring that all Content uploaded to the Service complies with
    applicable laws, regulations, and third-party rights. The Company disclaims liability for any claims arising from
    Content that infringes on intellectual property rights or contains unlawful or objectionable material.</p>
<p>In cases where multiple Users operate under a single Customer account, the Terms sometimes inconsistently refer to
    ownership rights as belonging to the "User" rather than the "Customer," which may create ambiguity regarding control
    and responsibility over Content. The Company’s prevailing interpretation is that the Customer, as the subscribing
    entity, maintains ownership and control over all Content within its account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, upon termination or expiration of the Customer’s subscription, the Company may, but is not obligated to,
    retain backup copies of Content for a limited period to comply with legal or operational requirements. During this
    period, the Content will be treated as confidential; however, the exact duration of retention is not explicitly
    defined in these Terms, potentially leading to uncertainty regarding post-termination data handling. Customers are
    encouraged to export or back up their Content prior to termination to avoid unintended data loss.</p>

<h3>License Grant</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants the Customer and its authorized
    Users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use Tool_3 solely for the
    purposes described herein. This license permits the User to utilize the Service, including its features and
    functionalities, strictly in accordance with the subscription plan selected and for lawful data analysis activities
    consistent with these Terms.</p>
<p>The license granted does not confer any ownership rights or title in the Service, software, or any underlying
    intellectual property, and the Customer acknowledges that all proprietary rights remain solely with the Company or
    its licensors. Users may not sublicense, distribute, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer access to Tool_3 without the
    Company's prior written consent. Furthermore, the license is conditioned upon the Customer's and Users' compliance
    with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations outlined in these Terms.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms "User" and "Customer" are sometimes used interchangeably in relation to
    license rights and obligations, which may lead to confusion regarding who holds specific permissions or
    restrictions, especially in multi-user organizational accounts. In the event of any inconsistency, the Company's
    interpretation shall prevail.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the license granted hereunder at its sole discretion,
    including for violations of these Terms or non-payment of fees. Any such termination or suspension shall not relieve
    the Customer from its payment obligations incurred prior to such action. Notably, while the license permits use of
    the Service, it does not grant the Customer any rights to reverse engineer, decompile, or derive source code from
    Tool_3, except as expressly permitted by applicable law. Any unauthorized use beyond the scope of this license may
    result in immediate termination of access and potential legal remedies.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Use</h3>
<p>The User and Customer agree to use Tool_3 strictly in accordance with these Terms and solely for lawful data analysis
    purposes. Unauthorized or improper use of the Service is expressly prohibited. Users shall not employ Tool_3 to
    engage in any activities that could harm, disrupt, or impair the functionality, security, or integrity of the
    platform or its underlying infrastructure. This includes, but is not limited to, attempts to overload the system,
    introduce malicious software, or circumvent any usage controls or access restrictions imposed by the Company.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Customer is responsible for ensuring that all Users under its account comply with these restrictions.
    Notwithstanding, the Terms occasionally refer to responsibilities as belonging to the "User" without clarifying
    whether this includes individual Users or the Customer entity, which may create ambiguity regarding enforcement and
    accountability in multi-user environments.</p>
<p>Users and Customers shall not use Tool_3 to process or transmit data that infringes on intellectual property rights,
    contains unlawful or offensive content, or violates any applicable laws or regulations. Attempts to reverse
    engineer, decompile, or otherwise extract proprietary source code or algorithms from Tool_3 are strictly forbidden
    except when expressly permitted by law. Any such violations may result in immediate suspension or termination of
    access, as well as potential legal action.</p>
<p>It is also prohibited to share or distribute access credentials with unauthorized individuals or third parties. The
    Company disclaims liability for any damages arising from unauthorized use resulting from failure to safeguard login
    information. However, in rare instances, the Company may permit continued access during investigations of suspected
    misuse, potentially causing uncertainty about enforcement timelines and account status.</p>
<p>Finally, the Company reserves the right to monitor usage and enforce these restrictions at its sole discretion.
    Failure to adhere to these limitations may lead to suspension, termination, or legal proceedings. The inconsistent
    use of "User" and "Customer" throughout this section may cause confusion about which party bears specific
    obligations or liabilities, and the Company's interpretation shall govern in case of conflict.</p>

<h2>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY PROVIDES TOOL_3 AND ALL RELATED SERVICES ON AN “AS IS”
    AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT
    WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR COMPLETELY SECURE, NOR THAT ANY RESULTS OR ANALYTICAL
    OUTPUTS DERIVED FROM TOOL_3 WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.</p>
<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE TOOL_3, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
    EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY
    THE CUSTOMER TO THE COMPANY IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE
    FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.</p>
<p>IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE THE TERMS REFER TO BOTH “USER” AND “CUSTOMER,” FOR PURPOSES OF LIABILITY, THE
    COMPANY MAY INTERPRET SUCH TERMS DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT. THIS INCONSISTENCY MAY AFFECT THE EXTENT TO
    WHICH INDIVIDUAL USERS OR THE CUSTOMER ENTITY CAN ASSERT CLAIMS OR SEEK DAMAGES. USERS AND CUSTOMERS ARE ADVISED TO
    REVIEW THEIR ACCOUNT AGREEMENTS CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.</p>
<p>FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS OR BREACH RESULTING FROM CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND ITS
    REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CYBERATTACKS, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE FAILURES, OR FORCE MAJEURE
    EVENTS. CUSTOMERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENT BACKUPS OF ALL DATA AND ANALYTICAL RESULTS TO MITIGATE
    POTENTIAL RISKS.</p>

<h3>Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS,
    IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO TOOL_3 AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED
    THEREUNDER.</p>
<p>The Service, including all software, features, and content, is provided “as is” and “as available,” without any
    warranty that it will meet the specific requirements or expectations of the User or Customer. While the Company
    endeavors to ensure that Tool_3 operates reliably and accurately, it does not warrant that the Service will be free
    from errors, interruptions, or omissions, nor that any analytical results or predictions generated are complete,
    timely, or error-free.</p>
<p>It is expressly acknowledged that the terms “User” and “Customer” are sometimes used inconsistently in this
    Agreement, and for purposes of this Warranty Disclaimer, the Company’s obligations and disclaimers apply equally to
    both parties, notwithstanding any conflicting definitions or references elsewhere. This may create ambiguity
    regarding the scope of coverage and recourse available to individual Users versus Customer entities, particularly in
    multi-user organizational accounts.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Company does not warrant the accuracy, reliability, or legality of any data uploaded or processed
    through Tool_3. The Customer remains solely responsible for verifying the quality and compliance of all Data and
    outputs derived from the Service. Any reliance on such data or outputs is at the User's or Customer’s own risk.</p>
<p>The Company further disclaims any warranties related to third-party integrations, data sources, or services accessed
    through Tool_3, as these components may be subject to separate terms and conditions beyond the Company’s control.
    Finally, the absence of an explicit warranty in these Terms does not constitute a waiver of any statutory rights the
    User or Customer may have under applicable law, which may not be fully disclaimed by contract.</p>

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, neither the Company nor its affiliates, licensors, or service
    providers shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages
    arising out of or relating to the use or inability to use Tool_3, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss
    of data, business interruption, or any other commercial damages or losses, even if the Company has been advised of
    the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>The aggregate liability of the Company to the User or Customer for any and all claims arising under or related to
    this Agreement shall not exceed the total amount paid by the Customer to the Company during the twelve (12) months
    immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation applies regardless of the form of action,
    whether in contract, tort, or otherwise.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms "User" and "Customer" are used variably within these Terms, and for the
    purposes of liability, the Company may treat these terms differently depending on context. This inconsistent usage
    may lead to ambiguity concerning which party has standing to assert claims or recover damages, especially in
    multi-user accounts where the Customer is the paying entity but individual Users operate the Service.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Company shall not be liable for any damages resulting from delays or failures in performance caused
    by events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to force majeure events, cyberattacks, or
    third-party service interruptions. The Company’s obligation to indemnify or compensate the Customer or User for such
    events is expressly disclaimed.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision herein, nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit the Company’s liability for
    death or personal injury caused by its negligence or for any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by
    law. Users and Customers are advised to review this section carefully to understand the scope and limitations of
    liability applicable to their use of Tool_3.</p>

<h3>Indemnification</h3>
<p>The User and Customer agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, licensors, and
    service providers, as well as their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and
    all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of
    or related to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any breach or alleged breach by the User or Customer of these Terms, including violations of applicable laws,
        regulations, or third-party rights;
    </li>
    <li>Any unauthorized use of Tool_3 or its Services, including but not limited to prohibited activities outlined in
        the Prohibited Activities section;
    </li>
    <li>The submission, upload, or transmission of content or Data that infringes intellectual property rights, is
        unlawful, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable;
    </li>
    <li>Any negligence, willful misconduct, or failure by the User or Customer to comply with their responsibilities
        under these Terms;
    </li>
    <li>Claims arising from the User’s or Customer’s use of analytical outputs or decisions made based on Data processed
        via Tool_3.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The obligation to indemnify applies equally to both the User and the Customer, notwithstanding the inconsistent use
    of these terms elsewhere in this Agreement, which may lead to ambiguity regarding which party bears indemnification
    responsibilities in multi-user or organizational contexts. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that all
    authorized Users under its account adhere to these indemnification obligations.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject
    to indemnification by the User or Customer, and the User or Customer agrees to cooperate fully with the Company in
    such defense. Failure by the User or Customer to provide timely notice of any claim or legal proceeding may limit
    their indemnification rights and obligations.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be indemnified for claims resulting solely from its own gross
    negligence or willful misconduct. The scope of indemnification herein does not extend to indirect, incidental, or
    consequential damages unless expressly provided for under applicable law.</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>Either the Company or the Customer may terminate this Agreement and the User’s access to Tool_3 at any time, with or
    without cause, by providing written notice to the other party. Termination may also occur immediately and without
    prior notice if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the User or Customer has materially breached
    any provision of these Terms, including but not limited to violations of the Prohibited Activities or Limitations
    and Restrictions sections.</p>
<p>Upon termination, all licenses granted hereunder shall immediately cease, and the User and Customer shall discontinue
    all use of Tool_3. The Company reserves the right to delete or retain any Data or Content associated with the User’s
    or Customer’s account following termination; however, the specific period for Data retention post-termination is not
    explicitly defined in these Terms, which may create uncertainty regarding data availability and deletion
    timelines.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination shall not relieve the Customer of its obligation to pay any fees accrued
    prior to termination, including any applicable charges for partial subscription periods. The Company may also
    suspend or restrict access to the Service prior to termination as a remedial measure or pending investigation of
    alleged breaches.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms “User” and “Customer” are occasionally used inconsistently in this section,
    where “User” may refer to individual account holders and “Customer” to the subscribing entity. This inconsistent
    terminology may affect the interpretation of termination rights and responsibilities, especially in multi-user
    organizational accounts.</p>
<p>Finally, the Company shall have no liability for any damages or losses resulting from termination or suspension of
    access, including loss of Data or interruption of Service, even if such termination occurs without prior notice.
    Users and Customers are encouraged to export and back up their Data regularly to mitigate potential data loss upon
    termination.</p>

<h3>Grounds for Termination</h3>
<p>The Company reserves the right to terminate or suspend the User’s or Customer’s access to Tool_3 immediately and
    without prior notice upon the occurrence of any of the following grounds:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Material breach of any provision of these Terms, including but not limited to violations of the Prohibited
        Activities, Limitations and Restrictions, or Payment obligations;
    </li>
    <li>Non-payment or failure to cure overdue amounts within a reasonable period after notice, although the definition
        of "reasonable period" remains unspecified and subject to the Company's discretion;
    </li>
    <li>Engagement in fraudulent, unlawful, or abusive conduct that adversely affects the integrity, security, or
        operation of the Service or the Company’s reputation;
    </li>
    <li>Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or export controls governing the use of Tool_3;</li>
    <li>Repeated or egregious unauthorized use of the Service, including attempts to circumvent license restrictions or
        reverse engineer the platform;
    </li>
    <li>Suspicion or evidence of unauthorized access or security breaches that compromise the confidentiality or
        integrity of the Service or Data;
    </li>
    <li>Discontinuation of the Service or specific features at the Company's sole discretion, which may lead to
        termination of access for affected Users or Customers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It is noteworthy that the Terms sometimes ambiguously refer to “User” or “Customer” in isolation when describing
    termination grounds, without clear distinction whether such actions apply solely to individual accounts or to the
    subscribing entity as a whole. This inconsistent terminology may create uncertainty, especially in multi-user
    organizational accounts, regarding whose access may be terminated and under what conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, while termination is generally effective immediately upon notice, the Company may, in certain
    circumstances, allow continued access during investigation or remediation periods, potentially causing confusion
    about the status of the User’s or Customer’s account. The Company disclaims liability for any damages or losses
    arising from termination or suspension, regardless of the timing or notice provided.</p>

<h3>Effect of Termination</h3>
<p>Upon termination of this Agreement, whether initiated by the Company or the Customer, all rights granted to the User
    and Customer under these Terms shall immediately cease, and access to Tool_3 shall be promptly disabled. The User
    and Customer must discontinue all use of the Service and delete or destroy any copies of proprietary software,
    documentation, or materials provided by the Company in connection with Tool_3. Notwithstanding termination, certain
    obligations, including payment of outstanding fees, confidentiality, indemnification, and limitation of liability
    provisions, shall survive and remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right, but is not obligated, to retain the User’s or Customer’s Data and Content for a
    period deemed reasonable following termination. However, as noted in other sections, the specific duration of
    post-termination data retention is not clearly defined herein and may vary at the Company’s sole discretion. This
    lack of specificity may lead to uncertainty for the Customer regarding the availability or deletion of Data after
    termination. Customers are strongly encouraged to export and back up all Data prior to termination, as the Company
    disclaims any liability for Data loss or inaccessibility thereafter.</p>
<p>In certain cases, the Company may delete Data immediately upon termination if required by law, regulatory
    obligations, or for security reasons. Conversely, the Introduction and Privacy sections suggest that Data may be
    retained indefinitely unless a deletion request is submitted, creating an apparent contradiction in data handling
    post-termination. The Customer should seek clarification from the Company if needed to understand the implications
    for their Data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms "User" and "Customer" are sometimes used interchangeably in this section, without clear
    distinction of their respective responsibilities or rights following termination. This inconsistent terminology may
    cause ambiguity, especially in multi-user accounts where individual Users may lose access while the Customer retains
    contractual obligations. The Company’s interpretation shall prevail in resolving any such ambiguities.</p>
<p>Finally, termination of this Agreement shall not affect any remedies available to the Company for breaches occurring
    prior to termination, and the Company reserves the right to pursue legal or equitable relief as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Survival of Terms</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the provisions set forth herein which by their
    nature are intended to survive shall continue in full force and effect. Such provisions include, but are not limited
    to, obligations relating to confidentiality, indemnification, intellectual property rights, limitations of
    liability, and payment of any outstanding fees. The User and Customer acknowledge that these surviving provisions
    are essential to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and ensure compliance with applicable laws and
    contractual commitments.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Company’s rights to retain and use Data as described in the Privacy and Data Protection sections
    shall remain effective following termination, subject to any Data deletion requests submitted in accordance with the
    Terms. However, given the inconsistencies noted elsewhere regarding data retention timelines—where Data may be
    retained indefinitely or deleted after a reasonable period—the exact duration and scope of post-termination Data
    processing may vary and is subject to the Company's sole discretion. Users and Customers are advised to seek
    clarification if uncertainty arises in this regard.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to note that while the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably throughout
    this Agreement, their respective obligations under surviving provisions may differ depending on the context. In
    certain instances, continuing obligations may apply primarily to the Customer as the contracting entity, whereas in
    others, individual Users may retain specific responsibilities. This inconsistent terminology may lead to ambiguity
    regarding post-termination duties and rights. The Company’s interpretation shall prevail in resolving any such
    discrepancies.</p>
<p>All indemnification obligations incurred prior to termination shall survive in accordance with the terms herein, and
    any dispute resolution or governing law provisions shall also remain applicable notwithstanding the cessation of
    Service access. The User and Customer agree that these surviving terms are necessary to enable the Company to
    enforce its rights and protect its interests effectively even after the end of the contractual relationship.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    Company is incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The User and Customer irrevocably submit
    to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that jurisdiction for the resolution of any disputes
    arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of Tool_3.</p>
<p>In the event of any disagreement or claim arising between the parties, the User and Customer agree to first attempt
    to resolve the matter through good faith negotiations. Should such informal resolution efforts fail within a
    reasonable period, either party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of a recognized
    arbitration institution selected by the Company. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the same
    jurisdiction specified for governing law, and the decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on both
    the User and Customer.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall prevent the Company from seeking injunctive or equitable
    relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights or confidential
    information. The User and Customer acknowledge and agree that any delay in seeking such relief may cause irreparable
    harm to the Company.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably throughout this section without
    clear differentiation of their respective rights or liabilities. This may create ambiguity in multi-user scenarios
    regarding which party is entitled to bring claims or is subject to jurisdictional requirements. The Company’s
    interpretation shall prevail in any such disputes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Company shall not be liable for any costs or damages arising from delays or failures in dispute
    resolution processes attributable to the User or Customer’s failure to comply with procedural requirements or to
    participate in good faith. Both parties are encouraged to engage promptly and cooperatively to minimize disruption
    to their use of Tool_3.</p>

<h3>Applicable Law</h3>
<p>The interpretation, validity, and enforcement of these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in
    which the Company is incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law rules. Both the User and Customer consent
    to the application of such laws for all matters arising out of or relating to their use of Tool_3 or this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain provisions of these Terms may be subject to mandatory local laws applicable to
    the User or Customer, particularly when the jurisdiction of the User differs from that of the Company. In such
    cases, the Company shall endeavor to comply with relevant legal requirements; however, Users and Customers
    acknowledge that the Terms may not fully reflect or address all local legal nuances, and it remains their
    responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p>It is also acknowledged that the terms "User" and "Customer" are used variably in this section, occasionally without
    clear distinction as to which party the governing law references specifically. This inconsistent terminology may
    create ambiguity in determining the extent of legal rights or obligations under differing jurisdictions, especially
    in multi-user accounts where the User may reside in a different legal environment than the Customer entity.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between the provisions of these Terms and mandatory local laws applicable to the User or
    Customer, such local laws shall prevail to the extent required by law. However, the Company disclaims any liability
    or responsibility arising from such conflicts or the User’s or Customer’s failure to comply with local legal
    obligations.</p>
<p>Users and Customers are encouraged to seek independent legal advice regarding the applicability and implications of
    governing law provisions, particularly when operating across multiple jurisdictions. The Company’s interpretation of
    applicable law shall be determinative for the purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise stipulated in a separate
    written contract between the parties.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Clause</h3>
<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including but not limited to the
    formation, interpretation, breach, or termination thereof, shall be resolved exclusively through binding
    arbitration, except where otherwise prohibited by law. The User and Customer expressly waive their right to a trial
    by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration institution selected by
    the Company, which shall apply the substantive law of the jurisdiction governing this Agreement. The arbitration
    proceedings shall take place in the city where the Company is incorporated, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by
    the parties. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the
    arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to seek preliminary or injunctive relief in any court
    of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights or confidential information prior to or during
    the arbitration process. The User and Customer acknowledge that such relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm
    to the Company.</p>
<p>It is important to note that references to "User" and "Customer" within this clause are used interchangeably and
    without clear distinction as to which party bears responsibility or standing in arbitration proceedings. This
    inconsistency may create ambiguity, particularly in multi-user organizational accounts where individual Users may
    not be signatories to the arbitration agreement. The Company’s interpretation shall prevail in any conflict arising
    from such ambiguity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the parties agree that any arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis only, and no
    arbitration shall proceed on a class, collective, or representative basis. Should any portion of this arbitration
    clause be found unenforceable or invalid, the remainder of the clause shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>For the purposes of any legal proceedings arising out of or related to these Terms, the User and Customer agree that
    the exclusive jurisdiction and venue shall lie within the courts of the jurisdiction where the Company is
    incorporated, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing. Both parties irrevocably consent to submit to the
    personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections based on inconvenient forum or lack of
    jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to initiate proceedings in any other jurisdiction
    deemed appropriate to enforce its rights or to protect its intellectual property and confidential information. In
    such cases, the User and Customer acknowledge and agree to cooperate fully with the Company in any legal actions,
    including providing necessary documentation or testimony.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the terms "User" and "Customer" are used inconsistently within this section, where "User" may
    refer to individual account holders and "Customer" to the subscribing entity. This inconsistent terminology may
    result in ambiguity regarding which party is subject to jurisdictional claims or responsible for legal compliance in
    multi-user organizational contexts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in situations where the User and Customer reside or are incorporated in different jurisdictions, the
    Company’s choice of governing jurisdiction shall prevail unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory local laws. This
    may lead to conflicts or uncertainty about applicable legal standards, particularly in cross-border engagements
    where multiple legal frameworks intersect.</p>
<p>Finally, the User and Customer acknowledge that compliance with the jurisdictional provisions herein is a material
    term of this Agreement. Failure to adhere to these provisions may result in suspension or termination of Service
    access. Users and Customers are advised to seek independent legal advice to understand their rights and obligations
    with respect to jurisdictional matters under these Terms.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service, including any documents expressly incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement
    between the Company and the User and Customer with respect to Tool_3 and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
    communications, whether oral or written. No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision shall be effective
    unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Company. However, the Company retains the
    unilateral right to modify these Terms as outlined in earlier sections, which may create occasional inconsistencies
    between written amendments and posted updates.</p>
<p>The failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver
    of such right or remedy, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise thereof.
    Any waiver granted by the Company must be explicitly stated in writing to be valid.</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, that provision shall be severed from the Terms without affecting the validity or enforceability of the
    remaining provisions. The User and Customer agree to cooperate in good faith to replace any such invalid provision
    with a valid provision that most closely approximates the original intent.</p>
<p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control,
    including but not limited to natural disasters, acts of government, cyberattacks, or labor disputes. In such events,
    the affected party shall notify the other as soon as reasonably practicable; however, what constitutes "reasonably
    practicable" may vary, introducing ambiguity in expected response times.</p>
<p>These Terms are binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
    permitted assigns. The User and Customer may not assign or delegate their rights or obligations without the prior
    written consent of the Company, except in the case of a corporate merger or acquisition. The inconsistent use of
    "User" and "Customer" within this section may cause confusion regarding which party’s rights are assignable,
    especially in multi-user organizational contexts.</p>
<p>Any notices required or permitted under these Terms shall be in writing and delivered via email, postal mail, or
    other electronic means to the contact information provided by the User or Customer. It is the responsibility of the
    Customer to ensure that such contact details remain current. Failure to receive notice due to outdated contact
    information shall not relieve the User or Customer of their obligations under these Terms.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement, including these Terms of Service and any documents expressly incorporated herein by reference,
    constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the Company and the User and Customer with respect to the
    subject matter herein and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, agreements, whether
    written or oral, relating to the use of Tool_3.</p>
<p>No other representations, warranties, or agreements, whether oral or written, not expressly set forth in this
    Agreement shall be binding on the Company or the User and Customer. Any amendments or modifications to this
    Agreement must be made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Company to be effective.
    However, as noted previously, the Company retains the unilateral right to update or modify these Terms through
    posting updated versions on its website, which may create occasional inconsistencies between written amendments and
    posted Terms.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any other document incorporated by reference,
    the provisions of these Terms shall govern unless otherwise explicitly stated. It is acknowledged that the terms
    "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, though in some contexts, this
    interchangeable usage may cause ambiguity as to the identity or obligations of the parties. The Company’s
    interpretation of these terms shall prevail in resolving any such ambiguity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any prior agreements, understandings, or communications between the parties relating to the subject
    matter of this Agreement are deemed null and void, except to the extent expressly referenced herein. The User and
    Customer acknowledge that they have not relied on any statements, promises, or representations not contained in this
    Agreement. Notwithstanding this, occasional discrepancies between these Terms and prior communications may exist due
    to the evolving nature of the Service and related policies.</p>
<p>Finally, the failure of the Company to enforce any provision of this Agreement at any time shall not be construed as
    a waiver of its right to enforce such provision in the future. Users and Customers are encouraged to review these
    Terms periodically to remain informed of any updates or changes that may affect their rights and obligations.</p>

<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or other
    competent authority, such provision shall be deemed severed from the Agreement to the extent of such invalidity,
    illegality, or unenforceability, without affecting the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining
    provisions. The Company and the User or Customer agree to negotiate in good faith to replace the severed provision
    with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the original intent and economic effect of the
    severed provision.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that severability may not always be straightforward, particularly where the invalidity of a clause
    impacts the broader contractual framework or fundamental obligations. In such cases, the entire Agreement may be
    subject to reconsideration or renegotiation. The terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this
    section, although in certain contexts this may cause ambiguity regarding which party holds the authority to engage
    in such renegotiations or to effectuate replacements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to waive or amend any provision unless such waiver or
    amendment is documented in writing and signed by an authorized representative. Failure to enforce a provision due to
    severability shall not be interpreted as a waiver of the Company’s rights to enforce other provisions. Any purported
    waiver or amendment made verbally or implied through conduct shall be considered null and void.</p>
<p>In the event that severance of a provision materially alters the rights or obligations of either the Company, User,
    or Customer, the affected party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice. However, what constitutes a
    “material alteration” is not explicitly defined herein, which may give rise to differing interpretations and
    potential disputes. Parties are encouraged to seek clarification from the Company in such scenarios to avoid
    unintended consequences.</p>

<h3>Amendments</h3>
<p>The Company reserves the right to amend, modify, or update these Terms of Service at any time, at its sole
    discretion, with or without prior notice to the User or Customer. Such amendments shall become effective immediately
    upon posting the revised Terms on the Company’s official website or through other communication channels deemed
    appropriate by the Company. It is the responsibility of both the User and the Customer to regularly review the Terms
    to remain informed of any changes.</p>
<p>By continuing to access or use Tool_3 following the posting of amended Terms, the User and Customer shall be deemed
    to have accepted and agreed to be bound by all such modifications. Should either party not agree to the amended
    Terms, they must immediately cease use of the Service and notify the Company accordingly. However, the Terms do not
    explicitly define the timeframe within which such notification must occur, which may create ambiguity as to the
    duration within which a User or Customer may reject amendments.</p>
<p>In some instances, the Company may require Users or Customers to provide affirmative consent to updated Terms through
    electronic acceptance mechanisms before continuing use of Tool_3. Failure to provide such consent may result in
    restricted access or suspension of Service features until acceptance is obtained.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms "User" and "Customer" are occasionally used inconsistently within this
    section; for example, some amendments may be communicated solely to the Customer as the subscribing entity, while
    others are directed to individual Users. This inconsistency may lead to confusion regarding which party is obligated
    to comply with or acknowledge the changes, especially in organizational accounts with multiple Users.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Company’s unilateral amendment rights notwithstanding, any material changes affecting fees,
    subscription plans, or core Service functionality will generally be communicated to the Customer with reasonable
    advance notice, though the definition of "reasonable" is not explicitly stated herein and may vary case by case.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure</h3>
<p>Neither the Company nor the User or Customer shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of their
    obligations under these Terms to the extent such failure or delay is caused by events beyond their reasonable
    control, including but not limited to natural disasters, acts of government or regulatory authorities, war,
    terrorism, labor disputes, pandemics, cyberattacks, or failures of third-party service providers ("Force Majeure
    Events").</p>
<p>In the event of a Force Majeure Event, the affected party shall promptly notify the other party in writing,
    describing the nature of the event, its expected duration, and the measures being taken to mitigate its impact.
    However, what constitutes "prompt" notification is not specifically defined herein and may vary based on the
    circumstances, potentially leading to differing expectations between the Company and the User or Customer.</p>
<p>During the continuation of a Force Majeure Event, the obligations of the affected party shall be suspended to the
    extent directly impacted by such event. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume normal
    performance as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding this, the Company disclaims any liability for damages or losses
    incurred due to delays or failures caused by Force Majeure Events.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms "User" and "Customer" are used inconsistently in this section, where "User"
    may refer to individual account holders and "Customer" to the subscribing entity, without explicitly clarifying the
    respective rights or responsibilities of each party during Force Majeure situations. This inconsistency may create
    ambiguity regarding notification duties and the scope of suspension of obligations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Company reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, whether an event qualifies as a Force
    Majeure Event, which may affect the applicability of this clause. The User or Customer acknowledges and agrees that
    such determination is final and binding, even if disputed. In cases where the Force Majeure Event persists beyond a
    period deemed reasonable by the Company, the Company may terminate the Agreement without liability upon providing
    written notice to the Customer and User.</p>
