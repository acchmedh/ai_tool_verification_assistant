    to ensure optimal performance and user satisfaction.</p>
<p>The scope of this agreement covers the availability, performance, support, and maintenance of the Tool_2 platform as
    delivered to the Customer. While the Service Provider will make commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
    uninterrupted service, the Customer acknowledges that certain factors beyond the Service Provider's control may
    impact service delivery.</p>
<p>Throughout this document, the terms "User" and "Customer" shall be used interchangeably to refer to the entity
    subscribing to and utilizing the Tool_2 services. The Service Provider commits to providing the User with timely
    updates and notifications regarding any scheduled maintenance or unexpected service incidents; however, the
    definition of “timely” shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Service Provider.</p>
<p>By entering into this SLA, the Customer agrees to the terms herein and acknowledges that the Service Provider retains
    the right to modify the service features and terms without prior notice. This document is intended to supplement,
    not replace, the general Terms of Service agreed to separately by the User.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this Service Level Agreement (SLA) is to establish clear and mutual understanding between the
    Service Provider and the Customer regarding the delivery and quality of the Tool_2 collaboration platform services.
    This Agreement delineates the obligations, performance metrics, and responsibilities of both parties to ensure the
    platform operates efficiently, reliably, and in accordance with the expectations of the User.</p>
<p>This SLA defines the scope of services provided, including uptime guarantees, support response times, data handling
    policies, and maintenance schedules. It also serves to manage the risks associated with service interruptions, data
    integrity, and confidentiality, thereby fostering trust and transparency between the Service Provider and the
    Customer. Notwithstanding, the Service Provider may from time to time adjust service parameters without prior
    consent, provided such changes do not materially degrade the overall service experience.</p>
<p>While this Agreement intends to specify the minimum acceptable service levels, it also acknowledges that the User is
    responsible for ensuring their internal systems are compatible and adequately maintained to interface effectively
    with Tool_2. The Customer agrees to notify the Service Provider within a reasonable period of any service issues;
    however, the exact timeframe for this notification is not explicitly defined herein, which may lead to
    interpretational discrepancies.</p>
<p>Additionally, this document aims to clarify that the terms "Customer" and "User" both refer to the subscribing party,
    though these terms may be used inconsistently throughout this document, potentially causing some ambiguity regarding
    the roles and responsibilities attributed to each designation. Overall, the intention is to create a framework that
    supports a collaborative partnership, promoting continuous improvement and user satisfaction in the deployment of
    the Tool_2 platform.</p>

<h3>Scope of Services</h3>
<p>The Service Provider agrees to deliver access to the Tool_2 collaboration platform, which encompasses features
    designed to facilitate real-time communication, data sharing, and project management among data analysts. These
    services include, but are not limited to, access to dashboards, report generation tools, user collaboration spaces,
    and integration capabilities with third-party data sources as mutually agreed upon. The Service Provider will ensure
    that the Service is available 99.5% of the time during each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.
    Scheduled maintenance shall typically occur during off-peak hours and will be communicated to the Customer at least

    the Service Provider retains the right to restrict access or suspend services if misuse or violation of the Terms of
    Service is suspected.</p>
<p>Data retention policies under this SLA stipulate that Customer data will be stored for a minimum period of 90 days
    following account termination. However, in some instances, backup copies may be retained for up to one year to
    comply with legal or operational requirements. This creates an inherent ambiguity regarding the final disposition of
    Customer data post-termination, which the Customer acknowledges and accepts. Furthermore, the terms "User" and
    "Customer" are used interchangeably in this section, despite minor inconsistencies elsewhere, which may lead to
    confusion regarding the party responsible for compliance with service obligations.</p>

<h3>Definitions and Terminology</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this SLA, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below. These definitions
    are intended to provide clarity and assist in the consistent interpretation of the agreement; however, some terms

        interpretative challenges between parties.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions collectively aim to establish a common understanding but should be read in conjunction with the
    detailed provisions elsewhere in this SLA to resolve any inconsistencies or ambiguities arising from the
    interchangeable terminology or undefined timeframes.</p>

<h2>Service Commitments</h2>
<p>The Service Provider commits to maintaining the Tool_2 collaboration platform in a manner that supports the
    agreed-upon service levels, ensuring availability, reliability, and performance consistent with industry standards.
    Specifically, the Service Provider guarantees 99.5% uptime per calendar month, excluding scheduled and emergency
    maintenance events. However, the exact calculation method for uptime is subject to internal metrics that may not be
    fully disclosed to the Customer, potentially resulting in minor discrepancies in availability reporting.</p>
<p>Technical support shall be available to the User during standard business hours, Monday through Friday, excluding
    public holidays. Response times for support requests will vary based on the severity level of the incident, but the
    SLA does not specify precise response or resolution times, which may lead to differing expectations. The Service
    Provider reserves the right to prioritize support cases at its discretion.</p>
<p>In the event of a service disruption, the Service Provider will endeavor to notify the Customer as soon as
    practicable. However, the term “as soon as practicable” is not explicitly defined, potentially leading to
    uncertainty regarding notification timeliness. Moreover, while the Service Provider strives to resolve issues
    promptly, no explicit guarantee is made regarding the timeframe for issue remediation.</p>
<p>Regarding data management, the Service Provider commits to retaining Customer data in accordance with the Data
    Retention Period defined previously. Notwithstanding, certain archived backup copies may be retained beyond the
    stated retention period for unspecified durations, which may conflict with Customer expectations for data deletion.
    The Service Provider also retains the right to suspend or restrict access to the Service if it suspects violation of
    the Terms of Service or misuse, though the criteria for such actions are not exhaustively detailed.</p>
<p>Overall, this section reflects the Service Provider’s dedication to delivering a dependable and responsive platform,
    while acknowledging the inherent limitations and discretionary elements that may affect the precise fulfillment of
    service commitments.</p>

<h3>Availability and Uptime Guarantees</h3>
<p>The Service Provider guarantees that the Tool_2 platform will be available to the Customer for at least 99.5% of each
    calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and emergency maintenance periods. Scheduled maintenance will be
    communicated to teh Customer at least 24 hours in advance, while emergency maintenance may be performed without
    prior notice and may temporarily impact service accessibility.</p>
<p>Availability is calculated based on total uptime divided by total hours in the month, excluding any periods of
    scheduled or emergency maintenance. However, the precise methodology and monitoring tools used to determine uptime
    are proprietary and will not be disclosed to the User, which might result in some variance between the Service
    Provider’s reported availability and the User’s internal measurements.</p>
<p>In cases where availability falls below the guaranteed threshold, the Customer may be eligible to receive service
    credits, subject to submission of a formal claim within a reasonable period following the end of the affected month.
    The term "reasonable period" is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, potentially leading to differing
    interpretations regarding claim eligibility deadlines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider acknowledges that unplanned outages caused by events beyond its reasonable control,
    including but not limited to force majeure events, third-party service failures, or Customer-side issues, shall not
    be counted against the availability guarantee. Notably, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably in
    this section without clarifying whether these obligations apply equally to both individual end-users and the
    subscribing entity, which may introduce ambiguity in responsibility allocation.</p>

<h3>Performance Standards</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall ensure that the Tool_2 platform operates in a manner consistent with generally accepted
    industry performance benchmarks for collaboration software tailored to data analysts. This includes maintaining
    system responsiveness, minimizing latency in data synchronization, and ensuring that all core functionalities, such
    as dashboard rendering and real-time messaging, perform within acceptable parameters under normal usage conditions.
    While the Service Provider endeavors to optimize these performance metrics, specific quantitative thresholds or
    service-level objectives for response times and throughput are not explicitly defined in this Agreement, potentially
    leading to interpretative variance regarding acceptable performance.</p>
<p>Performance monitoring will be conducted continuously using internal tools, the details of which remain confidential
    and may differ from the Customer’s own monitoring mechanisms. Consequently, discrepancies between reported
    performance and User-perceived experience may occur, without recourse for dispute resolution based solely on
    internal metrics. Furthermore, the Service Provider reserves the right to temporarily reduce performance levels
    during peak usage periods or emergency maintenance to preserve overall system stability, though such measures will
    be taken with the intent to minimize user impact.</p>
<p>In instances where performance degrades significantly or recurrently, the Customer—or User, as referred
    interchangeably herein—should report such issues promptly, within a reasonable period as previously defined
    ambiguously in this document. Failure to do so may affect the Service Provider’s ability to investigate and
    remediate performance concerns effectively. Notably, the terms "User" and "Customer" continue to be used
    interchangeably within this section, which may obscure whether individual users or the subscribing entity bear the
    responsibility for reporting and managing performance issues.</p>
<p>The Service Provider disclaims any guarantees regarding absolute performance levels outside the scope of scheduled
    maintenance and agreed service availability, and it shall not be held liable for performance deficiencies resulting
    from factors beyond its control, including but not limited to third-party integrations, Customer hardware
    limitations, or network connectivity issues.</p>

<h3>Data Sharing and Collaboration Features</h3>
<p>The Tool_2 platform offers a suite of data sharing and collaboration features aimed at enhancing the productivity and
    cooperative efforts of the Customer's data analysts. These features include, but are not limited to, shared
    workspaces, real-time editing, comment threads, version control, and customizable access permissions. The Service
    Provider endeavors to ensure that these collaborative tools function seamlessly to support efficient project
    management and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Users are granted the ability to share datasets and reports both internally within their organization and externally
    with approved third parties, subject to the access controls established by the Customer. It is the responsibility of
    the Customer to manage and enforce appropriate permission levels for individual Users to prevent unauthorized data
    disclosure. However, the SLA does not explicitly delineate the Service Provider’s liability in instances of data
    sharing misuse or inadvertent exposure resulting from Customer misconfiguration, which may lead to ambiguity
    regarding accountability.</p>
<p>While the platform supports integration with various third-party applications to facilitate extended collaboration
    capabilities, the Service Provider does not guarantee uninterrupted interoperability with all such external
    services. Any disruptions or limitations arising from third-party software may affect the overall collaboration
    experience without constituting a breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Data synchronization across User devices and collaborative sessions is intended to occur in near real-time; however,
    occasional delays may occur due to network conditions or system load. The Service Provider does not warrant absolute
    immediacy of updates, and Users acknowledge that some latency is inherent in the system architecture.</p>
<p>Lastly, the terms "User" and "Customer" are occasionally used interchangeably in this section, which may cause
    confusion when determining responsibility for managing collaboration settings and data sharing permissions within
    the platform.</p>

<h2>Support and Maintenance</h2>
<p>The Service Provider shall offer technical support to the Customer to facilitate the effective use of the Tool_2
    platform. Support services will be available during standard business hours, Monday through Friday, excluding public
    holidays, and shall encompass assistance with platform functionality, troubleshooting, and issue escalation. The
    Service Provider endeavors to respond to support requests within a reasonable period, although exact response or
    resolution times are not explicitly guaranteed herein, which may lead to differing expectations between the Service
    Provider and the User.</p>
<p>Support requests must be submitted through the designated channels specified by the Service Provider. The Customer is
    responsible for providing sufficient information to enable accurate diagnosis and resolution of reported issues.
    While the Service Provider retains discretion in prioritizing support tickets, no formal escalation process is
    defined in this Agreement, potentially causing ambiguity regarding the handling of critical or unresolved
    issues.</p>
<p>Maintenance activities, including scheduled updates and system improvements, will generally be conducted during
    off-peak hours and communicated to the Customer at least 24 hours in advance. However, emergency maintenance may be
    performed without prior notice and could temporarily impact access to the Service. The Service Provider will make
    commercially reasonable efforts to minimize service disruptions during maintenance but does not guarantee zero
    downtime during these periods.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms "Customer" and "User" continue to be used interchangeably within this section,
    which may create confusion concerning which party is responsible for initiating support requests or complying with
    maintenance notifications. Furthermore, the Service Provider reserves the right to suspend support or maintenance
    services if it reasonably suspects violation of the Terms of Service, though the criteria and procedures for such
    suspensions are not exhaustively detailed.</p>
<p>Overall, this section reflects the Service Provider’s commitment to providing adequate support and maintenance while
    acknowledging the inherent limitations and discretionary elements that may affect service continuity and issue
    resolution timelines.</p>

<h3>Support Tiers and Response Times</h3>
<p>The Service Provider offers multiple tiers of technical support to accommodate the varying needs of the Customer.
    These tiers include Standard Support and Premium Support, each with differing levels of service availability and
    response commitments. Standard Support is available during normal business hours, Monday through Friday, excluding
    public holidays, while Premium Support extends coverage to 24/7 availability, including weekends and holidays.</p>
<p>Response times for support requests are prioritized based on the severity of the issue reported. Critical incidents
    that severely impact the Service Provider’s platform functionality or prevent access to core features will receive
    the highest priority and, under Premium Support, will typically receive an initial response within one hour. For
    Standard Support, the initial response time for such critical issues is targeted within four business hours. Lower
    priority issues, such as general inquiries or minor functionality questions, will be addressed within a reasonable
    timeframe respective to the support tier; however, the SLA does not define specific resolution deadlines, which may
    result in differing expectations between the Service Provider and the User.</p>
<p>Support requests must be submitted through the Service Provider’s designated ticketing system or support portal. The
    Customer is responsible for accurately categorizing the severity of the issue; however, the Service Provider
    reserves the right to reclassify tickets based on its internal assessment. Notably, the terms "User" and "Customer"
    are used inconsistently in this section, with "User" sometimes referring to individual end-users and at other times
    to the subscribing organization, potentially causing confusion regarding who is entitled to access each support
    tier.</p>
<p>In all cases, the Service Provider will endeavor to provide timely and effective support, but no explicit guarantees
    are made regarding final resolution times. The Customer acknowledges that response and resolution targets may be
    impacted by factors beyond the Service Provider’s control, including but not limited to Customer-provided
    information completeness and third-party dependencies.</p>

<h3>Scheduled Maintenance</h3>
<p>Scheduled Maintenance refers to planned periods during which the Service Provider performs updates, upgrades, or
    other necessary technical activities to maintain or improve the Tool_2 platform. Such maintenance is typically
    conducted during off-peak hours to minimize disruption to the Customer's operations. The Service Provider shall
    notify the Customer of any Scheduled Maintenance at least 24 hours in advance via the primary communication channels
    established between the parties.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider endeavors to adhere strictly to the advance notice requirement, there may be instances
    where unforeseen circumstances necessitate a reduction in notification time. In such cases, the Service Provider
    will provide as much advance warning as reasonably practicable. The Customer agrees to accommodate these maintenance
    windows and acknowledges that service availability may be temporarily impacted during these periods.</p>
<p>The duration and frequency of Scheduled Maintenance will vary depending on the nature and scope of the work required.
    However, the SLA does not specify maximum allowable downtime per maintenance event, which may lead to differing
    expectations between the Service Provider and the User regarding acceptable maintenance impact.</p>
<p>Emergency Maintenance, distinct from Scheduled Maintenance, may be performed without prior notice when urgent issues
    arise that could compromise system integrity or security. Such Emergency Maintenance periods are excluded from
    uptime calculations and may cause temporary service unavailability.</p>
<p>It is important to note that within this section, the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably despite
    previous efforts to distinguish between these entities elsewhere in this Agreement. This inconsistency may cause
    some uncertainty about which party bears responsibility for acknowledging maintenance notifications or preparing
    internal systems accordingly. The Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or limit access during Scheduled
    Maintenance without liability for any resulting inconvenience or business impact.</p>

<h3>Emergency Maintenance</h3>
<p>Emergency Maintenance refers to unplanned and urgent technical interventions undertaken by the Service Provider to
    address critical issues that may threaten the stability, security, or integrity of the Tool_2 platform. Such
    maintenance activities are essential to mitigate immediate risks, prevent potential data loss, or resolve
    significant service disruptions.</p>
<p>Due to the urgent nature of Emergency Maintenance, the Service Provider may initiate these activities without prior
    notification to the Customer. While the Service Provider strives to minimize the duration and impact of such
    maintenance windows, it does not guarantee uninterrupted service during these periods. Emergency Maintenance events
    are excluded from the Service Availability calculations as defined in this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Service Provider will endeavor to notify the User of Emergency Maintenance occurrences as soon as reasonably
    possible following commencement. However, the term "reasonably possible" is not explicitly defined within this SLA,
    potentially leading to differing interpretations regarding the timeliness of such communications.</p>
<p>During Emergency Maintenance, the Service Provider may temporarily restrict or suspend access to certain platform
    features or services. The Customer acknowledges and accepts that such restrictions may be necessary to protect the
    overall system and that the Service Provider shall not be liable for any damages or losses arising from these
    temporary interruptions.</p>
<p>It is further noted that the terminology "User" and "Customer" continue to be used interchangeably in this section
    without clear distinction, which may cause ambiguity in identifying which party is responsible for monitoring
    notifications and coordinating internal responses to Emergency Maintenance events. The Service Provider reserves the
    right to perform Emergency Maintenance at its sole discretion and without prior consent from the Customer.</p>

<h2>Customer Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Customer acknowledges and agrees to fulfill certain responsibilities to ensure the effective use and optimal
    performance of the Tool_2 collaboration platform. Primarily, the Customer shall maintain all necessary hardware,
    software, and network infrastructure required to access and utilize the Service. This includes ensuring
    compatibility with the Tool_2 platform as specified by the Service Provider, though detailed technical
    specifications are outlined separately and may be updated periodically without explicit notification.</p>
<p>It is the Customer’s duty to manage and control access credentials and permissions for all Users within their
    organization, safeguarding against unauthorized use or data breaches. The Customer must promptly notify the Service
    Provider of any suspected security incidents or unauthorized access, ideally within a reasonable period following
    discovery. However, the exact timeframe for such notification is not specifically defined in this Agreement, which
    may lead to uncertainty regarding compliance obligations.</p>
<p>The Customer is responsible for the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of all data uploaded, shared, or
    processed through the Tool_2 platform. Any misuse of the Service, including but not limited to violation of
    applicable laws, infringement of third-party rights, or breach of the Terms of Service, may result in suspension or
    termination of access by the Service Provider at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Customer shall ensure that Users receive adequate training and instruction on the proper use of the
    Tool_2 platform to minimize operational errors and maximize collaboration efficiency. While the Service Provider may
    offer guidance and resources, ultimate responsibility for User competency rests with the Customer.</p>
<p>Finally, the terms “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably at times within this Agreement,
    including in this section, which may create ambiguity concerning which party is accountable for specific actions or
    compliance measures. The Customer accepts this inconsistency and agrees to assume responsibility for all obligations
    attributed under either designation.</p>

<h3>Proper Use of the Platform</h3>
<p>The Tool_2 platform is provided exclusively for lawful and authorized use by the Customer and its authorized Users in
    accordance with this Agreement and the Terms of Service. The Customer agrees to ensure that all Users utilize the
    platform solely for purposes consistent with the intended collaboration and data analysis functionalities described
    herein. Any use of the Service for activities that violate applicable laws, infringe upon intellectual property
    rights, or compromise the integrity and security of the platform is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>The Customer shall implement and enforce policies that prevent misuse, including but not limited to unauthorized
    access, data manipulation, or distribution of malicious code. Service Provider reserves the right to monitor
    platform usage patterns and may suspend or restrict access if it reasonably suspects activities inconsistent with
    proper use. However, the criteria for determining improper use are not exhaustively defined, which may lead to
    differing interpretations between the Service Provider and the Customer.</p>
<p>Users must refrain from attempting to circumvent security mechanisms or engage in behaviors that could degrade system
    performance or disrupt other Users’ experiences. The Service Provider is not liable for any damages or losses
    resulting from User actions that contravene these provisions, including unauthorized data sharing or platform
    misuse.</p>
<p>Notably, the terms "User" and "Customer" continue to be used interchangeably within this section, without clear
    distinction between individual user responsibilities and those of the subscribing entity, which may introduce
    ambiguity regarding accountability for breaches of proper use obligations.</p>
<p>In the event of suspected misuse, the Service Provider will notify the Customer and may take corrective actions at
    its discretion, including suspension or termination of access. The Customer agrees to cooperate fully with any
    investigations and to promptly address any identified issues to restore compliance with the terms of this
    Agreement.</p>

<h3>Data Security Practices</h3>
<p>The Service Provider is committed to implementing robust data security measures to protect the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of Customer data processed through the Tool_2 platform. These measures include, but are
    not limited to, encryption of data both at rest and in transit, multi-factor authentication options for User access,
    and regular security audits conducted by internal teams. The Service Provider employs industry-standard security
    protocols and best practices to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, data breaches, or other
    malicious activities.</p>
<p>Access controls are enforced to restrict data visibility strictly to authorized Users as designated by the Customer,
    with role-based permissions to ensure that sensitive information is shared only on a need-to-know basis. However,
    the SLA does not explicitly define the granularity of such controls or the exact mechanisms by which the Service
    Provider verifies compliance, creating some ambiguity regarding the scope of responsibility for data protection.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider undertakes reasonable efforts to maintain a secure environment, it does not guarantee
    absolute security or the prevention of all potential threats, particularly those originating from Customer-side
    vulnerabilities or third-party integrations. The Service Provider disclaims liability for security incidents
    resulting from improper Customer configurations or failure to adhere to recommended security practices.</p>
<p>Incident response procedures are in place to address detected security events, including prompt investigation,
    containment, and notification to the Customer. Notifications will be issued within a reasonable period following
    discovery; however, the term "reasonable period" is not further specified, which may lead to differing expectations
    about the timeliness of breach disclosures. Furthermore, the terms "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably in
    this section without clear differentiation, potentially causing confusion about which entity is responsible for
    implementing or responding to security measures.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>
<p>The Customer or User shall promptly report any suspected or actual issues affecting the Tool_2 platform’s
    functionality, performance, or security through the Service Provider’s designated support channels. Reports should
    include sufficient detail to enable the Service Provider to accurately diagnose and address the problem. The Service
    Provider recommends that issues be reported within a reasonable period following their detection; however, this
    timeframe is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which may result in differing interpretations and potential
    delays in issue resolution.</p>
<p>Support requests must be submitted via the official ticketing system or support portal, as outlined in the Support
    and Maintenance section. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that all Users adhere to these reporting
    procedures to facilitate efficient handling of incidents. Notably, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used
    inconsistently in this context, sometimes referring to the subscribing organization and at other times to individual
    end-users, which may cause ambiguity as to who is obligated to initiate the report.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of an issue report, the Service Provider will acknowledge the submission within a reasonable timeframe,
    though no explicit guarantee for acknowledgment timing is provided. The Service Provider will then assess the
    severity and impact of the reported issue and prioritize response efforts accordingly, based on internal criteria.
    While the Service Provider endeavors to resolve incidents as swiftly as possible, no formal commitment is made
    regarding resolution deadlines.</p>
<p>It is important to note that failure by the Customer or User to report issues in a timely manner may adversely affect
    the Service Provider’s ability to investigate and remediate the problem effectively, and may impact eligibility for
    any service credits or remedies under this Agreement. The Customer acknowledges and accepts these conditions as part
    of their responsibilities under this SLA.</p>

<h2>Service Credits and Remedies</h2>
<p>In the event that the Service Provider fails to meet the availability or performance standards set forth in this
    Agreement, the Customer may be entitled to receive service credits as a form of remedy. Service credits shall be
    calculated as a percentage of the monthly service fees paid by the Customer, proportionate to the duration and
    severity of the service degradation experienced. However, the exact formula and methodology for calculating such
    credits are determined solely by the Service Provider and are not explicitly detailed in this Agreement, which may
    result in ambiguity regarding the amount of compensation owed.</p>
<p>To qualify for service credits, the Customer must submit a formal claim within a reasonable period following the end
    of the affected billing cycle. The term "reasonable period" is not specifically defined herein, potentially leading
    to differing interpretations and possible disputes over claim timeliness. Claims submitted after this period may be
    denied at the Service Provider’s discretion.</p>
<p>Service credits represent the exclusive remedy available to the Customer for any failure by the Service Provider to
    meet the agreed service levels. Except as expressly provided herein, the Service Provider disclaims any liability
    for incidental, consequential, or indirect damages arising from service interruptions or performance issues.
    Furthermore, the Customer acknowledges that service credits do not constitute a waiver of the Service Provider’s
    right to enforce the Terms of Service or suspend services in cases of misuse or violation.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this section without clear
    distinction, which may create uncertainty as to which party is entitled to request or receive service credits.
    Additionally, the Agreement does not specify procedures for dispute resolution related to service credit claims,
    which may lead to prolonged disagreements between the parties.</p>

<h3>Eligibility for Service Credits</h3>
<p>Service credits may be granted to the Customer as compensation for any failure by the Service Provider to meet the
    guaranteed availability or performance standards outlined in this Agreement. To be eligible, the Customer must
    demonstrate that the service disruption or degradation was directly caused by the Service Provider’s failure to
    comply with the agreed service levels and was not attributable to factors outside the Service Provider’s reasonable
    control, including but not limited to force majeure events, Customer infrastructure deficiencies, or third-party
    service failures.</p>
<p>The Customer must submit a formal claim for service credits within a reasonable period following the conclusion of
    the billing cycle in which the incident occurred. While the term “reasonable period” is used consistently elsewhere
    in this Agreement, it remains undefined, which may lead to differing interpretations regarding claim submission
    deadlines. Claims submitted beyond this unspecified timeframe may be rejected at the sole discretion of the Service
    Provider.</p>
<p>Eligibility is contingent upon the Customer’s compliance with all reporting obligations, including timely
    notification of service issues and provision of sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim. Failure to adhere to
    these responsibilities may result in denial of service credit requests. Moreover, the Service Provider reserves the
    right to verify and audit the submitted claims and may withhold credits if the disruption is found to be caused by
    Customer misuse or violation of the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>It is important to note that service credits will be issued only to the subscribing organization identified as the
    Customer in this Agreement and not to individual Users or third parties. Nonetheless, references to “User” and
    “Customer” remain somewhat inconsistent throughout this document, which could create ambiguity as to the proper
    claimant under certain circumstances. The Service Provider’s decision regarding eligibility and the amount of
    service credits shall be final and binding, absent any separate dispute resolution mechanisms agreed upon by the
    parties.</p>

<h3>Calculation of Service Credits</h3>
<p>Service credits shall be calculated based on the extent to which the Service Provider fails to meet the guaranteed
    service levels as outlined in this Agreement. The calculation methodology considers the total duration of service
    unavailability or performance degradation during the affected billing cycle, expressed as a percentage of the total
    monthly service fee payable by the Customer. While this general approach is described herein, the precise formula
    and parameters used to compute service credits are proprietary to the Service Provider and will not be disclosed in
    detail to the User.</p>
<p>Typically, service credits are prorated in accordance with the severity and length of the outage, with higher
    percentages applied for extended or critical disruptions. However, the SLA does not specify exact thresholds or
    tiers for credit allocation, potentially leading to interpretational differences regarding eligibility and credit
    amounts. The Service Provider retains sole discretion to determine the final credit amount, which may be influenced
    by factors including but not limited to the nature of the incident, the Customer’s reporting timeliness, and any
    mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p>It is further noted that any service credits issued shall be applied as a reduction against future invoices and shall
    not be redeemable for cash or other monetary compensation. Service credits are exclusive to the Customer as the
    subscribing entity and shall not be transferable or assignable to individual Users or third parties. Nonetheless,
    the interchangeable use of "User" and "Customer" throughout this Agreement may cause some uncertainty as to the
    proper recipient of such credits in complex organizational structures.</p>
<p>Finally, service credits shall not exceed a maximum aggregate amount equal to 50% of the monthly service fee for the
    affected billing period. Any claims or disputes regarding the calculation or application of service credits must be
    submitted in writing within a reasonable period following the issuance of the credit, though the term "reasonable
    period" remains undefined in this Agreement, which may lead to potential disagreements about claim timeliness and
    validity.</p>

<h3>Claim Process</h3>
<p>To initiate a claim for service credits under this Agreement, the Customer must submit a formal written request to
    the Service Provider within a reasonable period following the end of the billing cycle in which the alleged service
    failure occurred. The claim must include detailed information describing the nature of the service disruption or
    degradation, the dates and times affected, and any supporting evidence such as logs or correspondence that
    substantiate the claim. Claims submitted after the unspecified “reasonable period” may be rejected at the sole
    discretion of the Service Provider.</p>
<p>The Service Provider will acknowledge receipt of the claim within a reasonable timeframe and commence an
    investigation to verify the validity of the reported incident. During this process, the Service Provider may request
    additional information or clarification from the Customer to facilitate a thorough evaluation. The Customer is
    expected to cooperate fully and provide all requested documentation promptly. Failure to do so may result in denial
    of the claim.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the investigation, the Service Provider will communicate its determination regarding claim
    eligibility and the corresponding service credit amount, if any. The Service Provider’s decision shall be final and
    binding, except where separate dispute resolution procedures have been mutually agreed upon in writing. Notably,
    this section refers exclusively to the “Customer” as the claimant, although earlier sections use “User” and
    “Customer” interchangeably, potentially causing ambiguity about who within the subscribing organization is
    authorized to submit claims.</p>
<p>Claims related to service disruptions caused by factors outside the Service Provider’s reasonable control, including
    but not limited to Customer infrastructure failures or force majeure events, will be deemed ineligible.
    Additionally, the Service Provider reserves the right to deny claims arising from Customer misuse, violation of the
    Terms of Service, or failure to comply with reporting obligations as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Exclusions and Limitations</h2>
<p>This Agreement expressly excludes any liability or obligation of the Service Provider for service interruptions, data
    loss, or performance issues caused by factors beyond its reasonable control. Such factors include, but are not
    limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, governmental actions, third-party service failures, internet
    service provider outages, and Customer infrastructure deficiencies. The Service Provider shall not be responsible
    for issues arising from the Customer’s failure to maintain compatible hardware, software, or network environments as
    specified in the Customer Responsibilities section.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider disclaims any warranties or guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, or
    reliability of data shared or generated through the Tool_2 platform. The Customer acknowledges that collaboration
    features rely on Customer-configured permissions and that the Service Provider is not liable for unauthorized data
    disclosures resulting from Customer mismanagement or misuse of access controls.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider’s total aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed
    the amount of service fees paid by the User in the three months preceding the claim. It is noted that the terms
    "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably in this section without clear distinction, which may create ambiguity
    as to which party’s payments are considered for limitation of liability.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Service Provider shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive
    damages, including lost profits or business interruptions, even if advised of the possibility thereof. This
    limitation applies irrespective of the cause or theory of liability, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Lastly, any failure by the Customer or User to promptly report issues or cooperate in investigations as outlined in
    the Reporting Issues section may further limit the Service Provider’s obligations and remedies. The ambiguity around
    the exact timeframe for such reporting, previously noted, may impact enforcement of these limitations.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure Events</h3>
<p>Neither the Service Provider nor the Customer shall be held liable for any failure or delay in performing their
    respective obligations under this Agreement if such failure or delay is caused by events beyond their reasonable
    control, commonly referred to as "Force Majeure Events." These events include, but are not limited to, natural
    disasters (such as floods, earthquakes, or hurricanes), acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, governmental restrictions
    or actions, labor strikes, internet or telecommunication failures, and failures of third-party services that are
    integral to the operation of the Tool_2 platform.</p>
<p>In the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the affected party shall promptly notify the other party of the
    circumstances and shall make all reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the event on the performance of their
    obligations. However, the SLA does not provide a specific timeframe within which such notification must be given,
    potentially leading to differing interpretations and delays in communication.</p>
<p>During the duration of a Force Majeure Event, the Service Provider’s obligations, including availability and support
    commitments, shall be suspended to the extent directly impacted by the event. The Customer acknowledges that service
    interruptions or degradations resulting from Force Majeure Events shall not be considered breaches of this
    Agreement, and no service credits or remedies will be granted for such periods.</p>
<p>It is further noted that references to "User" and "Customer" remain inconsistent in this section, with no
    clarification as to whether individual end-users or the subscribing organization bear the responsibility for
    providing notice or coordinating responses during Force Majeure circumstances. This inconsistency may introduce
    ambiguity in communication protocols and accountability.</p>
<p>Upon cessation of the Force Majeure Event, both parties shall resume their obligations under this Agreement as soon
    as reasonably practicable, though the term "reasonably practicable" is not explicitly defined, leaving room for
    subjective interpretation regarding the timeliness of resumption.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Dependencies</h3>
<p>The Tool_2 platform integrates with various third-party services and software to enhance its collaboration and data
    sharing capabilities. These third-party dependencies may include cloud storage providers, authentication services,
    data analytics tools, and communication platforms. While the Service Provider endeavors to ensure seamless
    interoperability with such external services, it does not guarantee uninterrupted or flawless integration at all
    times.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges that the performance, availability, and security of the Tool_2 platform may be affected by
    factors outside the Service Provider’s direct control due to reliance on these third-party providers. Consequently,
    service disruptions or degraded performance resulting from failures or limitations of third-party services shall not
    be deemed breaches of this Agreement by the Service Provider. Furthermore, the Service Provider disclaims any
    liability for data loss, security incidents, or compliance issues arising from third-party integrations.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Customer to review and comply with the terms and conditions imposed by third-party
    providers when utilizing integrated features. The SLA does not address support obligations for issues attributable
    solely to third-party services, and the Service Provider may require the Customer to engage directly with the
    third-party vendor for resolution.</p>
<p>Notably, references to “User” and “Customer” in this section are used interchangeably without clear distinction,
    which may cause some uncertainty regarding which party is responsible for managing third-party relationships and
    compliance matters. Additionally, while the Service Provider commits to maintaining the core platform’s
    functionality, no specific performance metrics or availability guarantees apply to the third-party integrations,
    leading to potential ambiguity in overall service expectations.</p>

<h3>Unauthorized Use</h3>
<p>The Customer and all authorized Users shall strictly refrain from any unauthorized use of the Tool_2 platform,
    including but not limited to access beyond granted permissions, attempts to bypass security controls, or engagement
    in activities that compromise the integrity or availability of the Service. Any such unauthorized use constitutes a
    material breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate suspension or termination of access by the Service
    Provider.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to monitor platform usage for indications of unauthorized activities and to
    take any necessary corrective measures without prior notice. However, the criteria and thresholds for identifying
    unauthorized use are not exhaustively defined herein, which may lead to differing interpretations between the
    Service Provider and the Customer regarding what constitutes a violation.</p>
<p>In the event of suspected unauthorized use, the Service Provider will endeavor to notify the Customer or User
    promptly; however, the definition of “promptly” is not explicitly established, potentially causing ambiguity about
    the timing and manner of such notifications. Furthermore, while the Service Provider may suspend or restrict access
    to prevent further unauthorized activities, the duration of such suspensions and the conditions for reinstatement
    are determined at the sole discretion of the Service Provider and are not detailed in this Agreement.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that all Users are adequately informed of their access rights and
    obligations under this Agreement, and to implement internal controls to prevent unauthorized activities. The
    Customer acknowledges that failure to manage User permissions appropriately may result in consequences for which the
    Service Provider will not be held liable.</p>
<p>Notably, this section continues the inconsistent use of the terms “User” and “Customer,” sometimes referring to the
    subscribing organization and at other times to individual authorized users, which may cause uncertainty regarding
    accountability for unauthorized use incidents. The Customer agrees to assume full responsibility for any
    unauthorized use arising from its own or its Users’ actions.</p>

<h2>Compliance and Certifications</h2>
<p>The Service Provider maintains adherence to applicable industry standards and regulatory requirements relevant to the
    operation of the Tool_2 collaboration platform. This includes compliance with data protection laws such as the
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and relevant provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),
    where applicable. The Service Provider also undertakes periodic third-party audits to validate security controls and
    operational effectiveness as part of its commitment to maintaining a secure and compliant service environment.</p>
<p>Certifications currently held by the Service Provider include ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management and
    SOC 2 Type II attestation for service organization controls. While these certifications demonstrate the Service
    Provider’s dedication to maintaining high standards, the SLA does not guarantee continuous certification status or
    cover future certifications, which may be obtained or relinquished at the Service Provider’s sole discretion without
    prior notice to the Customer or User.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges responsibility for ensuring its own compliance with applicable laws and regulations in
    connection with its use of the Tool_2 platform, including but not limited to data privacy obligations and
    industry-specific requirements. The SLA does not extend to the Service Provider’s liability or accountability for
    Customer or User failure to comply with such obligations. Furthermore, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used
    interchangeably in this section without clear distinction, which may cause ambiguity regarding which party is
    responsible for regulatory adherence in multi-user organizational environments.</p>
<p>In the event of a compliance audit or investigation involving the Tool_2 platform, the Service Provider agrees to
    provide reasonable cooperation and documentation as permitted by confidentiality and legal constraints. However, the
    scope and extent of such cooperation are subject to internal policies and may vary depending on the nature of the
    request. The Customer acknowledges that the Service Provider does not warrant or guarantee regulatory approval or
    exemption for the Customer’s specific use cases or data processing activities.</p>

<h3>Applicable Standards</h3>
<p>The Service Provider commits to adhering to recognized industry standards and best practices that govern the
    provision and management of collaboration platforms such as Tool_2. These standards include, but are not limited to,
    ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management, SOC 2 Type II controls for service organization effectiveness,
    and relevant frameworks for data privacy and protection such as GDPR and CCPA. Compliance with these standards is
    intended to ensure that the Service Provider maintains a secure, reliable, and resilient environment for the
    Customer's data and collaborative activities.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these commitments, the SLA does not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted adherence to every
    applicable standard at all times, as certifications or compliance statuses may be subject to periodic review,
    renewal, or modification at the Service Provider’s discretion. Furthermore, some standards may apply selectively
    depending on the Customer’s geographical location, industry sector, or specific use of the Tool_2 platform, which
    may create ambiguity regarding the exact scope of compliance obligations.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to update or modify its adherence to standards without prior notice to the
    Customer or User, provided such changes do not materially diminish the overall security or performance of the
    Service. It is the responsibility of the Customer to remain informed of any such changes and to assess their impact
    on regulatory or internal compliance requirements.</p>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, references to “Customer” and “User” within this section shall be interpreted to mean the
    subscribing organization unless explicitly stated otherwise. However, inconsistent usage of these terms elsewhere in
    this Agreement may cause uncertainty regarding individual versus organizational compliance roles. The Customer
    acknowledges that ultimate responsibility for compliance with applicable laws and standards rests with the
    subscribing entity, regardless of any ambiguous terminology used herein.</p>

<h3>Audits and Reporting</h3>
<p>The Service Provider agrees to cooperate with the Customer in facilitating audits related to the security,
    compliance, and operational performance of the Tool_2 platform. Such audits may be conducted by the Customer or by
    designated third-party auditors, subject to reasonable prior notice and mutual agreement on the scope and timing of
    the audit activities. The Service Provider will provide access to relevant documentation, logs, and reports
    necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set forth in this Agreement, provided that such disclosure
    does not violate confidentiality agreements or expose proprietary information.</p>
<p>Audit requests should be submitted in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance, although in exceptional cases,
    shorter notice may be accepted at the Service Provider’s discretion. The Customer acknowledges that the Service
    Provider’s ability to accommodate audit requests may be limited by operational constraints and security
    considerations. Furthermore, the SLA does not guarantee continuous or real-time audit access, which may lead to
    delays or limitations in reporting.</p>
<p>The Service Provider shall furnish periodic compliance and performance reports, including uptime statistics and
    security incident summaries, on a quarterly basis or as otherwise agreed. These reports are intended to assist the
    Customer in monitoring service levels and adherence to regulatory requirements. However, the exact content, format,
    and frequency of such reports may vary and are subject to the Service Provider’s internal policies. This variability
    may result in ambiguity about the sufficiency and timing of reporting deliverables.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably within this section,
    without clear distinction as to which entity is responsible for initiating audit requests or receiving reports. This
    inconsistency may cause confusion, particularly in organizations where multiple Users operate under a single
    Customer account. The Customer agrees to coordinate internally to ensure proper management of audit communications
    and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>Term and Termination</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue in full force and effect for an initial term of one
    (1) year ("Initial Term"), unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions herein. Upon expiration of
    the Initial Term, the Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year periods ("Renewal Terms") unless
    either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current
    term. Notwithstanding, the Service Provider reserves the right to modify the renewal terms or fees upon renewal,
    subject to prior notice to the Customer.</p>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other party materially breaches any of its obligations and
    fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice specifying the breach.
    Additionally, the Service Provider may terminate or suspend the Customer’s access immediately and without prior
    notice if it reasonably suspects misuse, violation of the Terms of Service, or unauthorized use of the Tool_2
    platform.</p>
<p>Termination by the Customer for convenience is permitted upon providing sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the
    Service Provider. However, termination fees or early termination charges may apply as detailed in a separate
    agreement or invoice, which the Customer acknowledges and agrees to abide by.</p>
<p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Service Provider will retain Customer data for a minimum of
    ninety (90) days to facilitate data export or transition, after which the data will be deleted or anonymized.
    However, as noted in previous sections, backup copies of Customer data may be retained for up to one year, creating
    a potential inconsistency regarding final data disposition timelines. The Customer is responsible for ensuring data
    backup prior to termination, as the Service Provider disclaims liability for any data loss occurring after the
    retention period.</p>
<p>Throughout this section, the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably without clear distinction, which
    may cause ambiguity regarding which party holds termination rights or obligations, especially in multi-user
    organizational contexts. The parties agree to interpret these terms in light of the overall intent of this
    Agreement.</p>

<h3>Agreement Duration</h3>
<p>The duration of this Agreement shall align with the term provisions outlined in the Term and Termination section,
    commencing on the Effective Date and continuing through the Initial Term and any subsequent Renewal Terms, unless
    earlier terminated in accordance with the stipulated conditions. Notwithstanding the automatic renewal mechanism,
    either party may seek to renegotiate the terms of this Agreement prior to the commencement of any Renewal Term,
    subject to mutual written consent. However, absent such negotiation or written amendment, the Agreement’s terms will
    persist unchanged.</p>
<p>It is expressly acknowledged that the Service Provider retains the unilateral right to modify certain service
    parameters, fees, or policies upon renewal, provided that notice is given to the Customer within a “reasonable
    period” prior to the renewal date. The term “reasonable period” is not explicitly defined within this Agreement,
    which may lead to differing interpretations regarding the adequacy and timing of such notifications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during any dispute resolution or claim process
    initiated by either party concerning obligations or remedies arising under this Agreement, even if such processes
    extend beyond the formal expiration or termination date. This provision ensures continuity of rights and
    responsibilities, though the SLA does not specify the maximum duration for which obligations may persist
    post-termination, leading to potential ambiguity.</p>
<p>For clarity, references to “Customer” and “User” in this section are employed interchangeably, consistent with prior
    usage throughout this Agreement. This interchangeable terminology may be subject to differing interpretations
    regarding which party holds specific rights related to duration, renewal, or continuation of obligations,
    particularly in complex organizational structures with multiple authorized Users.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party under the following conditions: (i)
    material breach of any term or condition herein that remains uncured after thirty (30) days from receipt of written
    notice specifying the breach; (ii) insolvency, bankruptcy, or the commencement of any proceeding relating to the
    dissolution or liquidation of the other party; or (iii) mutual agreement between the parties to terminate the
    Agreement.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Tool_2 platform immediately and without
    prior notice if it reasonably suspects unauthorized use, violation of the Terms of Service, or other misuse,
    regardless of whether a cure period has been provided. However, the criteria used to determine such violations are
    not exhaustively delineated within this Agreement, potentially leading to differing interpretations and disputes
    regarding the legitimacy of termination actions.</p>
<p>Termination by the Customer for convenience requires written notice at least sixty (60) days prior to the intended
    termination date. Notwithstanding this, the Customer acknowledges that any termination fees or early termination
    penalties set forth in separate agreements or invoices remain applicable and enforceable. The Agreement does not
    explicitly address whether such fees apply if the Service Provider initiates termination for cause, which may lead
    to ambiguity in financial obligations upon termination.</p>
<p>Upon termination or expiration, the Service Provider will retain Customer data for a minimum of ninety (90) days to
    facilitate data export. Nevertheless, as noted in prior sections, backup copies may be retained for up to one year,
    thereby creating a potential conflict regarding final data deletion timelines. The Customer is responsible for
    ensuring timely data retrieval, as the Service Provider disclaims liability for any data loss following the
    expiration of the retention period.</p>
<p>Throughout this section, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used inconsistently, sometimes referring to the
    subscribing entity and at other times to individual end-users, potentially causing confusion about which party holds
    specific termination rights or obligations. The parties agree to interpret these terms in accordance with the
    overall context of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Post-Termination Obligations</h3>
<p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Customer shall promptly cease all use of the Tool_2 platform
    and related services. The Service Provider will deactivate access credentials associated with the Customer’s account
    within a commercially reasonable timeframe, which may vary depending on the circumstances surrounding the
    termination. However, the precise timing for deactivation is not explicitly defined herein, potentially leading to
    uncertainty regarding continued access during the transition period.</p>
<p>The Customer is responsible for exporting and securely storing any data retained within the Tool_2 platform prior to
    the termination date. While the Service Provider commits to retaining Customer data for a minimum of ninety (90)
    days post-termination, it may also retain backup copies for up to one year as previously noted, creating an apparent
    inconsistency regarding the ultimate deletion timeline. The Customer acknowledges this discrepancy and agrees that
    the Service Provider is under no obligation to preserve data beyond the stated retention periods.</p>
<p>Following data export, the Customer must certify in writing that all proprietary information and any confidential
    materials obtained through the Service have been deleted or returned, as applicable. The Service Provider reserves
    the right to verify such certification but is under no duty to enforce or monitor the Customer’s compliance with
    this obligation. Notably, the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably in this section, which
    may cause ambiguity about whether individual Users or the subscribing organization bear responsibility for
    post-termination actions.</p>
<p>Moreover, any outstanding fees or charges incurred prior to termination shall remain payable in accordance with the
    payment terms set forth in this Agreement. The Service Provider disclaims any liability for data loss or service
    unavailability occurring after the retention period, and the Customer agrees to hold the Service Provider harmless
    from any claims arising from post-termination data handling or access restrictions.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its
    breach, termination, or validity, the parties agree to seek an amicable resolution through good faith negotiations.
    Either the Customer or the Service Provider may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice to the other
    party describing the nature of the dispute and the desired remedy. The parties shall then attempt to resolve the
    matter within a reasonable timeframe, which is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, potentially leading to
    differing expectations regarding the duration of negotiation efforts.</p>
<p>If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within the unspecified reasonable period, either party may
    submit the matter to binding arbitration under the rules of a mutually agreed arbitration body. The arbitration
    shall be conducted in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties, or failing agreement, at the Service
    Provider’s principal place of business. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on both the
    Customer and the User, notwithstanding the inconsistent use of these terms throughout this Agreement, which may
    create ambiguity as to which party is bound by the arbitration outcome.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party retains the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of
    competent jurisdiction to prevent imminent or ongoing harm, without waiving the obligation to arbitrate other
    claims. Legal fees and costs shall be borne by the losing party unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator or
    court. The parties agree to keep all dispute-related information confidential except as required by law or to
    enforce a legal judgment.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision supersedes any prior agreements or understandings relating to dispute handling
    between the parties, but does not preclude the Service Provider from exercising any rights or remedies provided
    under this Agreement or applicable law. The lack of precise definitions and inconsistent terminology in this section
    may cause interpretational challenges and should be considered in the context of the entire Agreement.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    Service Provider has its principal place of business, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The parties
    agree that any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including questions regarding its existence,
    validity, or termination, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that
    jurisdiction, unless otherwise agreed in the Dispute Resolution section.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the application of mandatory laws or regulations relevant to the Customer’s or User’s
    location may supersede certain provisions of this Agreement to the extent such laws cannot be waived or modified by
    contract. The Customer acknowledges responsibility for ensuring compliance with any local legal requirements
    applicable to its use of the Tool_2 platform. The terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably in this
    section despite potential differences in legal standing or capacity, which may create ambiguity regarding which
    entity is subject to jurisdiction or legal obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between the governing law provisions herein and any mandatory local law, such mandatory
    provisions shall prevail, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties
    further agree that any legal action or proceeding related to this Agreement must be commenced within one year after
    the cause of action arises; failure to do so shall result in the waiver of such claims. However, this limitation
    period may conflict with longer statutory periods applicable in certain jurisdictions, potentially leading to
    enforceability issues.</p>
<p>By entering into this Agreement, the Customer and User expressly consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
    the designated courts and waive any objections thereto, including claims of inconvenient forum. This consent shall
    survive termination or expiration of the Agreement. Any ambiguity in terminology or jurisdictional scope shall be
    resolved in favor of the Service Provider’s principal place of business.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Process</h3>
<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its breach, termination,
    or validity, that is not resolved through negotiation shall be subject to binding arbitration as described herein.
    The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the arbitration body mutually agreed upon by the
    Customer and the Service Provider. If the parties fail to agree on the arbitration forum within thirty (30) days of
    the initiation of arbitration, the Service Provider’s chosen arbitration institution shall govern the
    proceedings.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall take place in the jurisdiction of the Service Provider’s principal place of business unless
    otherwise agreed in writing. The parties acknowledge that the arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on
    both the Customer and the User, despite the inconsistent use of these terms throughout this Agreement, which may
    create uncertainty as to who is bound by the arbitration outcome. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
    any remedies available under applicable law, including injunctive relief, but shall not have authority to modify the
    terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the arbitration unless the arbitrator determines
    otherwise. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted confidentially, and both parties agree to keep all
    information and documents disclosed during arbitration confidential, except as required by law or to enforce the
    award. Notwithstanding these provisions, the Service Provider reserves the right to seek preliminary injunctive
    relief or other urgent equitable remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to or during arbitration.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the timeline for arbitration proceedings is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which
    may lead to potential delays or uncertainty regarding the duration of dispute resolution. Furthermore, the terms
    “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably in this section without clear definition, potentially causing
    ambiguity about the parties’ respective rights and obligations within the arbitration process.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    Service Provider maintains its principal place of business, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The
    parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located within this jurisdiction for
    the resolution of any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
    Service Provider reserves the right to initiate legal proceedings in any other jurisdiction deemed appropriate to
    enforce its rights or protect its interests.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that, while references to “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably throughout this
    Agreement, for purposes of jurisdictional determination, the subscribing entity identified as the Customer shall be
    considered the primary party subject to legal proceedings. However, this distinction is not consistently maintained
    in all sections, potentially leading to ambiguity as to whether individual Users may also be subject to
    jurisdictional obligations or litigation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Agreement requires that any legal action related to this Agreement must be commenced within one year
    after the cause of action arises. This limitation period may conflict with statutory deadlines in certain
    jurisdictions, which could affect enforceability or lead to disputes over timeliness. The parties agree to interpret
    such provisions in favor of the Service Provider’s principal place of business jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between this jurisdiction clause and the Dispute Resolution section, the provisions
    herein shall prevail solely for matters concerning venue and choice of law, except where mandatory local laws
    require otherwise. The Customer expressly waives any objections to jurisdiction or venue, including claims of
    inconvenient forum, except as otherwise provided under applicable law.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Service Provider and the Customer regarding the
    subject matter herein and supersedes all prior communications, agreements, or representations, whether oral or
    written. Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by authorized
    representatives of both parties. Notwithstanding, the Service Provider reserves the unilateral right to update
    certain service features or policies without prior written consent, provided that such changes do not materially
    impair the Customer’s use of the Tool_2 platform.</p>
<p>The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision of this Agreement shall not affect the remaining
    provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. In such
    event, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith a substitute provision that reflects the original intent as
    closely as possible.</p>
<p>Neither party shall assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
    consent of the other party, except that the Service Provider may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger,
    acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets without Customer approval. The terms "Customer" and
    "User" shall be interpreted to mean the subscribing entity unless otherwise explicitly stated; however, inconsistent
    terminology throughout this Agreement may cause some uncertainty regarding assignment rights.</p>
<p>All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered via email, certified mail,
    or other agreed-upon means to the contact information provided by each party. Notices shall be deemed effective upon
    receipt or, if sent by email, upon confirmation of delivery, though the Agreement does not specify procedures for
    handling failed or delayed transmissions, potentially leading to ambiguity in notice effectiveness.</p>
<p>This Agreement does not create any partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties. Neither
    party shall have the authority to bind or obligate the other without express prior written consent. The Customer
    acknowledges that the inconsistent use of terminology such as "User" and "Customer" throughout this document may
    cause confusion regarding the identity and authority of parties in certain contexts, and agrees to interpret such
    terms in alignment with the intent of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Amendments to the Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement may be amended or modified from time to time by mutual written consent of both the Service Provider
    and the Customer. Any such amendments shall be documented in writing and signed by authorized representatives of
    both parties to be effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider reserves the unilateral right to
    update or modify certain service features, policies, or terms without prior written consent from the Customer,
    provided that such changes do not materially degrade the overall service experience or adversely affect the User's
    core access to the Tool_2 platform.</p>
<p>Notifications of unilateral amendments will generally be communicated to the Customer within a reasonable period
    prior to the effective date of the change; however, the term “reasonable period” is not explicitly defined in this
    Agreement, which may lead to differing interpretations regarding the timing and adequacy of such notifications. In
    cases where the Service Provider exercises this unilateral modification right, the Customer’s continued use of the
    Service after the effective date shall constitute acceptance of the amended terms.</p>
<p>Any amendments proposed by the Customer must be submitted in writing and are subject to approval by the Service
    Provider, which may be withheld at its sole discretion. The parties agree that no oral modifications or side
    agreements shall be binding unless properly documented and signed. Furthermore, references to “Customer” and “User”
    in this section are used interchangeably without clear distinction, which may create ambiguity concerning who within
    the subscribing entity has authority to consent to or request amendments.</p>
<p>In the event of conflicting provisions between an amendment and the original Agreement, the terms of the signed
    amendment shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. However, if any amendment conflicts with mandatory
    applicable law or regulatory requirements, such provisions shall be deemed void and the remainder of the Agreement
    shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement, including all attachments, exhibits, and any documents expressly incorporated herein by reference,
    constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the Service Provider and the Customer concerning the
    subject matter hereof. It supersedes all prior negotiations, proposals, representations, or agreements, whether
    written or oral, relating to the provision and use of the Tool_2 collaboration platform services.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges that it has not relied upon any statement, warranty, or representation not expressly set
    forth in this Agreement in entering into this Agreement or in using the Service. Any prior understandings,
    agreements, or representations that are inconsistent with the terms contained herein shall have no force or effect
    unless expressly incorporated in a written amendment as provided in the Amendments to the Agreement section.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider retains the right to update or modify certain service features,
    policies, or terms unilaterally, as described elsewhere in this Agreement, without the requirement for additional
    written consent from the Customer or User. The Customer’s continued use of the Service following such modifications
    shall constitute acceptance of the amended terms.</p>
<p>In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any other documents or
    communications between the parties, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail unless otherwise explicitly agreed in
    writing. However, due to the inconsistent use of the terms "User" and "Customer" throughout this Agreement, there
    may be ambiguity as to which party certain obligations or rights apply, particularly in multi-user organizational
    contexts. The parties agree to interpret such references reasonably and in good faith to effectuate the intent of
    this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or void under applicable law, such
    provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement without affecting the validity, enforceability, or
    applicability of the remaining provisions. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith a replacement provision that
    reflects the original intent of the severed clause to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a fundamental provision is found to be unenforceable and cannot be replaced or
    amended to restore its enforceability, the parties may mutually agree to terminate the Agreement without penalty or
    further obligation. However, in the absence of such mutual agreement, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in
    full force and effect, and the parties shall continue to fulfill their respective obligations.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the terms “User” and “Customer” are used inconsistently throughout this Agreement, and such
    inconsistencies shall not be construed to invalidate or impair the enforceability of any severable provision. Where
    ambiguity arises due to this inconsistent terminology, the interpretation most favorable to the Service Provider
    shall prevail, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the parties recognize that certain provisions may be subject to differing interpretations depending on
    jurisdictional requirements or regulatory mandates. In such cases, the severability clause shall be applied in a
    manner that preserves the maximum lawful effect of the Agreement as a whole, even if specific terms require
    modification or limitation.</p>
<p>Finally, the Service Provider reserves the right to update or amend any severed or replaced provisions unilaterally
    to ensure continued compliance with evolving legal and regulatory standards, with notification provided to the
    Customer within a reasonable period, although the term “reasonable period” is not explicitly defined in this
    document, which may lead to differing expectations regarding the timing of such amendments.</p>
