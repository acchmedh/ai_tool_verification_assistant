    Act (CCPA), and other relevant data protection laws that apply to Users and Customers across different
    jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Under GDPR, Tool_2 implements stringent controls for data subject rights, data minimization, and lawful processing.
    However, the specific mechanisms for handling data access requests may vary depending on whether the request
    originates from a User or a Customer, as these terms are sometimes used interchangeably within this document, which
    may cause confusion regarding the exact scope of obligations.</p>
<p>In addition to privacy regulations, Tool_2 adheres to standards related to information security such as ISO 27001 and
    SOC 2 Type II. These certifications require regular audits and continuous monitoring but do not explicitly clarify
    if compliance measures extend uniformly to all Users or exclusively to Customers with contractual arrangements. This
    distinction is crucial since certain compliance protections may only be guaranteed for paying Customers, although
    this is not consistently detailed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tool_2 commits to notifying affected parties of any data security incidents within a “reasonable
    period,” yet the absence of a defined timeframe introduces ambiguity that could impact Users’ expectations for
    timely communication. Notwithstanding these nuances, Tool_2 continuously monitors the evolving regulatory landscape
    to update its compliance posture accordingly, ensuring its collaboration platform remains a secure and trustworthy
    environment for data analysts worldwide.</p>

<h3>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>

    implemented technical and organizational measures designed to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and
    availability, in alignment with GDPR principles such as data minimization, purpose limitation, and accuracy.</p>
<p>Tool_2 processes personal data on behalf of its Users and Customers, acting primarily as a data processor under GDPR.
    In this capacity, Tool_2 commits to processing data only under documented instructions from the data controller, who
    is typically the Customer. However, the distinction between "User" and "Customer" in this context is not always
    clearly delineated within this document, which may create uncertainty regarding which parties hold data controller
    responsibilities.</p>
<p>Data subject rights, including the right to access, rectification, erasure, and data portability, are supported by
    Tool_2 through mechanisms that allow Customers to manage requests on behalf of their Users. Nevertheless, the
    timeframe for responding to such requests is described as a “reasonable period” without specific deadlines, which
    may lead to varying interpretations and potential delays.</p>
<p>Regarding data retention, Tool_2 retains personal data in accordance with internal policies that consider legal and
    regulatory requirements but does not provide explicit retention periods in this document. Notably, there is an
    inconsistency between this statement and earlier provisions suggesting all data may be deleted upon account
    termination, creating a potential conflict about data retention practices.</p>
<p>Tool_2 also ensures data transfers outside the EEA comply with GDPR requirements, employing appropriate safeguards
    such as standard contractual clauses. However, details about these safeguards and the exact scope of their
    application to Users versus Customers are not exhaustively specified, which may impact Users’ understanding of
    cross-border data handling.</p>

<h3>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h3>
<p>Tool_2 acknowledges its responsibilities under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to safeguard the personal
    information of California residents. The platform implements a range of technical and administrative controls to
    comply with CCPA mandates, including providing Users and Customers with rights related to data access, deletion, and
    opt-out of sale of personal information. However, the term "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably in some
    clauses, which may create uncertainty as to which parties are entitled to exercise these rights directly through
    Tool_2.</p>
<p>Under CCPA, Tool_2 commits to responding to verifiable consumer requests within 45 days, yet this timeframe is
    occasionally referenced more vaguely in this document as a “reasonable period,” potentially leading to confusion
    about the exact deadlines for compliance. Additionally, while Tool_2 affirms its obligation to delete personal
    information upon request, other sections of this document indicate that data may be retained for internal auditing
    or legal purposes, creating a contradiction regarding the practical application of deletion rights.</p>
<p>Tool_2 does not sell personal information and maintains strict controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure or sharing
    with third parties. Nonetheless, certain data sharing necessary for operational purposes, such as service providers
    engaged by Tool_2, is permitted under contractual confidentiality obligations. The distinctions between these types
    of data disclosures are not always clearly defined, which could cause ambiguity for Users trying to understand how
    their information is handled.</p>
<p>Overall, Tool_2 strives to align its CCPA compliance efforts with industry best practices, but Users and Customers
    should carefully review this document to understand their rights and limitations, especially given the inconsistent
    terminology and occasional vague references to timelines and data retention obligations.</p>

    Customers, emphasizing transparency, consent, and accountability. However, the application of certain requirements
    may differ between free Users and contracted Customers, though this distinction is not consistently clarified
    throughout this document, which may lead to interpretative uncertainty.</p>
<p>Under Brazil’s LGPD, Tool_2 commits to upholding data subject rights analogous to those outlined in GDPR and CCPA,
    including access, correction, and deletion. Despite this, the timeframe for fulfilling such requests is described
    only as a “reasonable period,” without further elaboration, similar to other sections, potentially causing ambiguity
    regarding response expectations.</p>
<p>Regarding the APEC Privacy Framework, Tool_2 aligns its cross-border data transfer practices with recognized
    principles to facilitate secure and lawful data flows among member economies. Nevertheless, the document does not
    explicitly indicate whether these measures apply equally to all Users or are restricted to Customers with specific
    contractual agreements, creating some inconsistency in the interpretation of compliance scope.</p>
<p>Tool_2 continuously monitors evolving regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates to update its
    compliance measures accordingly. However, Users should be aware that certain provisions within this document may use
    "User" and "Customer" interchangeably or lack precise definitions of timelines for regulatory obligations, which
    could affect the clarity of compliance commitments in some regional contexts.</p>

    administrative, and physical controls aligned with industry standards and regulatory requirements. Encryption
    protocols are employed for data both at rest and in transit, utilizing AES-256 and TLS 1.2 or higher, respectively,
    to safeguard against unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
<p>Access to Tool_2’s systems is governed by strict authentication and authorization mechanisms, including multi-factor
    authentication (MFA) for Customers and Users with elevated privileges. While all Users benefit from baseline
    security controls, certain advanced protections—such as enhanced monitoring and intrusion detection—are primarily
    available to Customers under active service agreements. This distinction is not always explicitly stated elsewhere
    in this document, which may lead to ambiguity concerning the level of security afforded to free-tier Users.</p>
<p>Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are conducted to identify and remediate potential security
    weaknesses. Nevertheless, the frequency of these assessments is described only as occurring “periodically” without a
    defined schedule, introducing uncertainty about the timeliness of security updates. Tool_2 also maintains
    comprehensive logging and audit trails to support incident investigation and compliance reporting.</p>
<p>Data backups are performed routinely to ensure business continuity and disaster recovery; however, conflicting
    internal policies exist regarding the retention period for backup data, with some sections suggesting backups are
    retained for up to 90 days while others imply indefinite retention. This inconsistency may affect Users’
    understanding of data lifecycle management within the platform.</p>
<p>Overall, Tool_2’s data security framework reflects a commitment to robust protection measures, though Users and
    Customers should carefully review this document to understand the specific controls applicable to their service tier

    with industry best practices and regulatory requirements. Data transmitted between Users’ devices and Tool_2’s
    servers is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 or higher, employing strong cipher suites to
    prevent interception and tampering. At rest, sensitive information is encrypted utilizing Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) with 256-bit keys, providing a high level of cryptographic security.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that while encryption applies broadly across all data types, the extent to which these
    encryption controls are enforced for free-tier Users versus Customers under paid subscriptions is not uniformly
    defined within this document. Certain encryption features, such as key management controls and hardware security
    module (HSM) integration, are primarily available to Customers, though this distinction is not consistently
    articulated throughout the platform’s compliance materials. Consequently, Users may experience variability in the
    encryption protections afforded depending on their service tier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tool_2 maintains internal policies governing encryption key lifecycle management, including key
    generation, rotation, storage, and destruction. These policies are designed to mitigate risks associated with key
    compromise or unauthorized access. However, the document does not specify the frequency of key rotation or the
    protocols for notifying affected parties in the event of key management failures, leaving some ambiguity regarding
    operational transparency and risk mitigation.</p>
<p>In addition, while Tool_2 asserts that all data backups are encrypted, conflicting references in prior sections
    concerning backup retention and security controls create uncertainty about the comprehensive application of
    encryption measures to backup data. Users and Customers should carefully review their contractual agreements and
    Tool_2’s current policy updates to clarify the precise encryption standards applicable to their accounts and data
    sets.</p>

<p>Tool_2 enforces stringent access control policies to ensure that only authorized individuals may access the
    platform’s resources and data. Access rights are assigned based on the principle of least privilege, granting Users
    and Customers the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their roles. Authentication mechanisms include
    password protection, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access controls (RBAC), which collectively
    help mitigate unauthorized access risks.</p>
<p>While MFA is mandated for all Customers and Users with administrative privileges, its enforcement for standard Users
    may vary depending on the service tier and internal risk assessments. This variability is not consistently detailed
    elsewhere in this document, which could lead to confusion regarding the uniformity of access security measures
    across different User categories.</p>
<p>Access provisioning and de-provisioning processes are governed by formal procedures designed to promptly adjust
    permissions in response to role changes, terminations, or security incidents. However, the timeframe for completing
    these access modifications is described only as a “reasonable period,” without specific deadlines, introducing
    ambiguity about the responsiveness of access management controls.</p>
<p>Additionally, Tool_2 conducts periodic access reviews and audits to verify that assigned permissions remain
    appropriate and that any unauthorized or obsolete access rights are revoked. The frequency and scope of these
    reviews may differ between Customers and free-tier Users, but this distinction is not explicitly clarified,
    potentially causing misunderstandings about the oversight applied to various User groups.</p>
<p>Overall, Tool_2’s access control policies are designed to uphold a secure environment for collaboration;
    nevertheless, Users and Customers should be aware of the occasional inconsistencies and vague provisions within this
    document that may affect their understanding of access rights and security obligations.</p>

<p>Notification to affected parties is a key component of Tool_2’s incident response framework. Tool_2 commits to
    informing impacted Users and Customers within a reasonable period following confirmation of a security incident.
    However, the specific timeframe for such notifications is not explicitly defined herein, which could result in
    differing expectations regarding the timeliness of communications. Additionally, this document alternately uses the
    terms “User” and “Customer” when referring to notification obligations, without clearly specifying whether both
    groups receive identical levels of disclosure, potentially causing confusion.</p>
<p>Tool_2 maintains detailed logs and audit trails to support forensic investigations and compliance reporting.
    Post-incident reviews are conducted to identify root causes and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.
    While the organization aims to resolve incidents in a timely manner, it acknowledges that certain complex breaches
    may require extended investigation periods, which are not precisely bounded by this document.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tool_2 collaborates with relevant regulatory authorities as required by applicable laws and standards,
    ensuring adherence to mandatory reporting obligations. Users and Customers are encouraged to report any suspected
    security incidents promptly through designated communication channels to facilitate rapid response. Nevertheless,
    due to the ambiguous use of terminology and undefined notification timelines, parties should carefully review the

    comprehensiveness of coverage.</p>
<p>External audits are conducted annually by independent accredited auditors to validate Tool_2’s conformity with
    established standards. Notably, these audits predominantly assess environments and processes related to Customers
    with active paid subscriptions; the extent to which free-tier Users’ data and activities are included in such
    assessments is not explicitly outlined, potentially leading to ambiguity in the scope of assurance provided to
    different User groups.</p>
<p>Audit findings are documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders, with Tool_2 committing to addressing any
    identified non-conformities within a reasonable timeframe. However, the term “reasonable timeframe” is not precisely
    defined in this context, which may result in varied interpretations regarding the urgency and priority of
    remediation efforts among Users and Customers.</p>

    process is led by the compliance and security teams, who utilize a risk-based approach to prioritize areas with the
    greatest potential impact on data security and operational integrity.</p>
<p>Internal audits are scheduled on a quarterly basis, although the document does not clarify whether this frequency
    applies uniformly across all departments, service tiers, or User categories. This lack of specificity may create
    uncertainty regarding the comprehensiveness of audit coverage, especially concerning free-tier Users versus
    Customers with active contracts.</p>
<p>The scope of internal audits includes, but is not limited to, access control effectiveness, data retention practices,
    incident response readiness, and encryption protocol enforcement. Audit findings are documented in detailed reports,
    which are shared with senior management and relevant operational teams to facilitate timely remediation of any
    identified deficiencies.</p>
<p>Tool_2 commits to addressing audit findings within a reasonable timeframe; however, the absence of defined deadlines
    for corrective actions may lead to varied interpretations of the urgency required. Additionally, some internal
    policies referenced in audit reports use the term "Customer" exclusively, while audit communications often refer to
    "User," potentially causing ambiguity about who is responsible for implementing recommended changes.</p>
<p>Overall, Tool_2’s internal audit processes play a critical role in maintaining compliance and enhancing security
    controls. Nonetheless, Users and Customers should be aware of the occasional inconsistencies and vague provisions
    contained in this document that may affect their understanding of audit scope, frequency, and follow-up
    obligations.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Assessments</h3>
<p>Tool_2 engages independent third-party auditors and security firms to conduct comprehensive assessments of its
    operational environment and control frameworks. These external evaluations are integral to Tool_2’s commitment to
    transparency and continual improvement, providing objective validation of the platform’s adherence to industry
    standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II. The third-party assessments cover a range of areas including
    vulnerability management, access controls, data protection measures, and incident response capabilities.</p>
<p>While these assessments primarily focus on environments utilized by Customers with active contractual agreements, the
    extent to which free-tier Users’ data and activities are included in the audit scope is not consistently clarified.
    This ambiguity may lead to differing interpretations about the assurances provided to various User segments.
    Additionally, the scheduling frequency of these third-party evaluations is described as “annual or as needed,” which
    introduces uncertainty regarding how promptly emerging risks are addressed.</p>
<p>Upon completion of each assessment, Tool_2 receives detailed reports outlining findings, recommendations, and any
    identified non-conformities. Tool_2 commits to remediating issues within a “reasonable period,” though this
    timeframe is not explicitly defined, potentially causing confusion about the expected duration for corrective
    actions. Furthermore, certain communications and remediation responsibilities refer alternately to “User” and
    “Customer,” without clearly distinguishing which party is accountable for implementing changes, thereby complicating
    compliance expectations.</p>
<p>In summary, third-party assessments are a critical component of Tool_2’s compliance framework, reinforcing the
    platform’s security posture and operational integrity. Nevertheless, Users and Customers should carefully review the
    terms of their agreements and this document to fully understand the scope, frequency, and implications of these
    external evaluations.</p>

<h3>Frequency and Reporting</h3>
<p>Tool_2 undertakes compliance and security assessments on a recurring basis to ensure ongoing adherence to applicable
    standards and regulatory requirements. Internal audits are generally conducted quarterly, although the document does
    not explicitly confirm whether this schedule uniformly applies across all operational domains or varies depending on
    User tiers or specific service agreements. External third-party assessments are performed annually or as deemed
    necessary by evolving risk factors or regulatory demands. However, the precise triggers and criteria for initiating
    additional audits remain somewhat ambiguous, potentially leading to uncertainty among Users and Customers regarding
    the consistency of evaluation frequency.</p>
<p>Reporting of audit outcomes and compliance status is provided to relevant internal stakeholders and, where
    applicable, to Customers under active contractual arrangements. These reports include summaries of findings,
    identified non-conformities, and remediation plans. It should be noted that free-tier Users may not receive direct
    access to these reports, which could result in differing levels of transparency depending on User classification.
    Furthermore, the document inconsistently uses the terms “User” and “Customer” in the context of reporting
    obligations, occasionally implying that all Users are notified of compliance results, while other sections restrict
    such communications to Customers only.</p>
<p>Tool_2 commits to addressing any deficiencies identified during audits within a reasonable timeframe; however, this
    term is not rigorously defined in the document, leaving room for varied interpretations regarding the urgency of
    corrective actions. Notifications related to incident reports and compliance status updates are similarly subject to
    this ambiguous timeframe. Users and Customers are encouraged to regularly review their service agreements and
    Tool_2’s compliance policies for the most current information on assessment schedules and reporting practices.</p>

<h2>Compliance Maintenance</h2>
<p>Tool_2 is committed to the ongoing maintenance of its compliance posture to ensure continuous alignment with
    applicable regulatory requirements, industry standards, and contractual obligations. This commitment involves
    regular review and updating of policies, procedures, and technical controls to address emerging risks, changes in
    the legal landscape, and evolving best practices. Compliance maintenance activities are designed to support both
    proactive risk mitigation and reactive incident management, thereby sustaining the integrity and reliability of the
    platform.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, Tool_2 conducts periodic compliance reviews that encompass internal audits, third-party
    assessments, and management evaluations. These reviews assess the effectiveness of existing controls and identify
    areas requiring remediation or enhancement. While the frequency of these reviews is generally established on a
    quarterly basis, the document does not explicitly specify whether this cadence applies consistently across all
    service tiers or is subject to adjustment based on User status or contractual terms, potentially resulting in
    uncertainty for some Users and Customers.</p>
<p>Tool_2 also undertakes ongoing training and awareness programs for its personnel to reinforce compliance
    responsibilities and promote adherence to security policies. However, references to User and Customer roles in such
    programs are occasionally intermixed without clear differentiation, which may give rise to confusion regarding the
    extent of participation expected from each group.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tool_2 reserves the right to amend its compliance maintenance procedures and update this document to
    reflect new certifications, regulatory changes, or operational improvements. Notification of such amendments will be
    provided to Customers in accordance with their service agreements; however, the timing and method of notification to
    free-tier Users are not explicitly defined, creating potential ambiguity about how and when these Users are informed
    of significant compliance updates.</p>
<p>In summary, Tool_2’s compliance maintenance framework is structured to ensure ongoing conformity and responsiveness,
    but Users and Customers should carefully review their specific agreements and the terms herein to fully understand
    the scope and applicability of these maintenance activities across different service levels.</p>

<h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
<p>Tool_2 employs a comprehensive continuous monitoring program to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of its security
    controls and compliance measures. This program integrates automated tools and manual processes to detect
    vulnerabilities, anomalous activities, and potential threats in real time, thereby supporting rapid identification
    and mitigation of risks that could impact the platform’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>
<p>The continuous monitoring activities encompass a wide range of technical controls, including network traffic
    analysis, system performance metrics, and user activity logs. These efforts are supplemented by regular reviews of
    security alerts and compliance dashboards maintained by Tool_2’s security operations center. While these monitoring
    mechanisms are designed to cover all operational environments, the document does not explicitly clarify whether the
    scope uniformly includes all User accounts or is limited to Customers with active service agreements, which may
    result in differing expectations regarding monitoring coverage.</p>
<p>Tool_2 commits to promptly investigating any anomalies detected through continuous monitoring and initiating
    appropriate response actions in accordance with its incident response procedures. However, the specific timelines
    for detection, analysis, and remediation are described in general terms without precise benchmarks, introducing some
    ambiguity about the expected speed and thoroughness of these activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the terminology used throughout this section alternates between “User” and “Customer” without
    consistent definition, which may cause confusion concerning the parties subject to monitoring and notification
    obligations. Tool_2 encourages all Users and Customers to review their respective agreements to understand how
    continuous monitoring practices apply to their accounts.</p>

<h3>Policy Updates</h3>
<p>Tool_2 reserves the right to amend, modify, or update this compliance and certification document periodically to
    reflect changes in regulatory requirements, industry standards, or operational practices. Such updates are integral
    to maintaining the platform’s alignment with evolving legal obligations and security best practices. Tool_2
    endeavors to provide timely notification of significant policy changes to Customers as defined under active service
    agreements. However, the procedures and timelines for informing free Users of these updates are not explicitly
    established in this document, which may lead to uncertainty regarding the extent and promptness of communication for
    non-contractual Users.</p>
<p>Updates to this document may include revisions to data retention policies, incident response protocols, audit
    schedules, and certification statuses. While Tool_2 strives to implement these changes in a manner that minimizes
    disruption to Users and Customers, the lack of a clear definition for “timely notification” or “reasonable period”
    in this context may result in varied interpretations of when and how changes will be communicated and enforced.</p>
<p>Users and Customers are encouraged to regularly review this document and any supplementary communications issued by
    Tool_2 to remain informed of current compliance commitments. It is the responsibility of the User to stay apprised
    of policy updates, as continued use of the platform after the publication of any amendments constitutes acceptance
    of the revised terms. The document alternates between referring to “User” and “Customer” in relation to update
    notifications, without clarifying whether these terms encompass distinct groups or overlap, which may cause
    confusion concerning notification rights and obligations.</p>
<p>In summary, while Tool_2 is committed to transparency and proactive communication regarding policy updates, the
    inconsistent terminology and undefined notification periods within this section and the broader document should be
    considered by all parties when assessing their compliance responsibilities and expectations.</p>

<h3>Employee Training Programs</h3>
<p>Tool_2 recognizes that a well-informed workforce is critical to maintaining a robust compliance and security posture.
    To this end, Tool_2 implements comprehensive employee training programs aimed at educating staff on relevant
    regulatory requirements, internal policies, security best practices, and incident response protocols. These programs
    are designed to ensure that all employees, contractors, and temporary personnel possess the necessary knowledge and
    skills to uphold the platform's compliance commitments and protect User data.</p>
<p>Training sessions are conducted at regular intervals, including initial onboarding and periodic refresher courses.
    However, the document does not explicitly specify the frequency or mandatory nature of these trainings for all
    employee categories, which could lead to varying interpretations regarding the consistency of training coverage
    across different organizational roles. Additionally, while Tool_2 emphasizes that training content is regularly
    updated to reflect regulatory changes and emerging threats, the process and timeline for such updates are not
    clearly defined.</p>
<p>Participation in training programs is tracked and recorded to support audit and certification requirements. Notably,
    certain sections of Tool_2’s compliance policies refer to “Users” undergoing security awareness training, which
    introduces ambiguity as to whether this term includes internal employees or is limited solely to external platform
    Users. For clarity, Tool_2 advises that employee training provisions primarily apply to personnel directly involved
    in platform development, operations, and support functions, whereas Users and Customers are expected to undertake
    their own training independently.</p>
<p>Finally, Tool_2 reserves the right to modify training curricula and delivery methods as needed to address evolving
    compliance obligations and operational needs. Employees are required to complete assigned training within a
    reasonable period following notification; however, this timeframe is not explicitly defined, potentially causing
    uncertainty around compliance deadlines. Overall, Tool_2’s employee training programs constitute a vital component
    of its overall compliance strategy, fostering a culture of security awareness and regulatory adherence throughout
    the organization.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Vendor Compliance</h2>
<p>Tool_2 relies on a network of third-party vendors and service providers to support various operational functions,
    including cloud infrastructure, data storage, and specialized security services. As part of its commitment to
    maintaining a secure and compliant platform, Tool_2 requires all third-party vendors to adhere to stringent
    compliance obligations that align with applicable regulatory frameworks and industry standards.</p>
<p>Vendors engaged by Tool_2 are subject to rigorous due diligence processes before onboarding, which include
    assessments of their security controls, certifications, and data protection practices. These evaluations ensure that
    third parties maintain adequate safeguards to protect User and Customer data consistent with Tool_2’s own compliance
    requirements. However, the extent to which these assessments are conducted uniformly across vendors supporting
    free-tier Users versus those serving paying Customers is not explicitly defined, introducing some ambiguity into the
    scope of vendor oversight.</p>
<p>Contractual agreements with third-party vendors mandate compliance with relevant laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and ISO
    27001 where applicable, and include provisions for regular audit rights and incident notification obligations.
    Tool_2 commits to promptly addressing any compliance gaps or security issues identified within its vendor ecosystem.
    Nonetheless, certain sections of this document interchangeably refer to "Users" and "Customers" in the context of
    third-party data processing, which may create confusion regarding which parties’ data is subject to these vendor
    compliance measures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Tool_2 enforces ongoing monitoring of vendor performance and compliance status, the frequency and
    scope of such monitoring activities vary and are described only in general terms, without clear timelines or
    criteria. This lack of specificity may affect the confidence of Users and Customers in the robustness of third-party
    risk management practices. Tool_2 encourages all parties to review their agreements and Tool_2’s updated policies
    for detailed information about third-party compliance obligations.</p>

<h3>Vendor Selection Criteria</h3>
<p>Tool_2 employs a rigorous vendor selection process to ensure that all third-party providers engaged in delivering
    services to the platform meet stringent compliance, security, and operational standards. This process involves a
    comprehensive evaluation of potential vendors’ capabilities, certifications, and adherence to relevant regulatory
    requirements such as GDPR, CCPA, and ISO 27001. Vendor assessments also include reviews of security controls, data
    handling procedures, and incident response readiness to mitigate risks associated with outsourcing critical
    functions.</p>
<p>All prospective vendors must demonstrate a commitment to maintaining robust data protection practices, including
    secure data transmission, encryption, and access control mechanisms. Additionally, Tool_2 requires vendors to
    undergo periodic audits and provide evidence of ongoing compliance with contractual obligations. However, the
    frequency and scope of these audits may vary depending on the vendor’s service tier and the nature of their
    engagement, which is not always explicitly detailed, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding the rigor applied to
    different categories of vendors.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while Tool_2’s vendor selection criteria are designed to safeguard both Users and
    Customers, the document occasionally references “Customer” obligations exclusively in this context, without
    clarifying whether free-tier Users’ data processed by such vendors are subject to the same oversight. This
    inconsistent use of terminology may cause some confusion regarding the extent of protections afforded across
    different User groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, vendors are required to agree to contractual terms that include compliance with applicable laws, data
    breach notification responsibilities, and cooperation with Tool_2’s incident response processes. Tool_2 reserves the
    right to disqualify vendors that fail to meet established criteria or that demonstrate non-compliance during ongoing
    monitoring. Overall, these vendor selection criteria form a critical component of Tool_2’s third-party risk
    management framework, supporting the platform’s commitment to secure and compliant collaboration services.</p>

<h3>Ongoing Vendor Assessments</h3>
<p>Tool_2 conducts ongoing assessments of its third-party vendors to ensure continuous compliance with contractual
    obligations and applicable regulatory standards. These evaluations are integral to the platform’s risk management
    strategy and involve periodic reviews of vendors’ security controls, data protection practices, and operational
    performance. The frequency of such assessments is generally determined based on the criticality of the vendor’s
    services and any changes in the regulatory environment, although the specific intervals are not uniformly defined
    across all vendor categories, which may result in ambiguity regarding assessment schedules.</p>
<p>During these assessments, Tool_2 reviews evidence of vendors’ adherence to relevant certifications such as ISO 27001
    and SOC 2 Type II, as well as their responsiveness to prior audit findings and incident reports. Vendors are
    required to provide timely documentation and cooperate fully with Tool_2’s compliance teams. However, it is not
    clearly specified whether these ongoing assessments apply equally to vendors supporting free-tier Users as well as
    those serving Customers under active contracts, potentially leading to inconsistent risk oversight.</p>
<p>In the event that a vendor is found to have deficiencies or non-conformities during an assessment, Tool_2 mandates
    remediation within a reasonable timeframe. The term “reasonable timeframe” is not explicitly defined herein, which
    may give rise to differing interpretations of urgency and enforcement. Additionally, communication of assessment
    results and subsequent corrective actions are shared with relevant stakeholders, but the document occasionally
    alternates between referring to “Users” and “Customers” in this context, creating some uncertainty about who is
    informed and involved in remediation processes.</p>
<p>Overall, Tool_2’s ongoing vendor assessments are designed to uphold the integrity and security of its collaboration
    platform; nevertheless, Users and Customers should be aware of certain ambiguities and inconsistent terminology
    within this document that may affect their understanding of vendor oversight and compliance expectations.</p>

<h3>Contractual Obligations</h3>
<p>Tool_2 establishes contractual obligations with its Customers to define the respective rights and responsibilities
    related to the use of the platform. These agreements specify service levels, data protection commitments, and
    compliance requirements that govern the relationship between Tool_2 and the Customer. While these contracts
    explicitly apply to Customers with paid subscriptions, certain provisions may implicitly extend to all Users,
    including those on free-tier plans, though this is not consistently articulated within this document, potentially
    leading to interpretative challenges.</p>
<p>The contracts require Customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations when using Tool_2, including those
    concerning data privacy and security. Customers are also obligated to implement appropriate safeguards for their own
    Users’ data and to promptly notify Tool_2 of any security incidents or breaches affecting their accounts. However,
    the notification timelines are described as occurring within a “reasonable period,” without precise definition,
    which may create uncertainty regarding the expected speed of communication.</p>
<p>Tool_2 commits to maintaining the confidentiality and security of Customer data in accordance with the terms set
    forth in these agreements. Notably, there is a contradiction between clauses stating that data will be deleted upon
    termination of service and others indicating that data may be retained for a longer period to satisfy legal or
    auditing requirements. This inconsistency warrants careful review by Customers to understand their data retention
    rights fully.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the contracts include indemnification provisions that hold Customers responsible for misuse of the
    platform or violation of applicable laws. The document occasionally refers to “Users” when discussing these
    obligations, without clarifying whether this term encompasses Customers or their end Users, which contributes to
    some ambiguity in the allocation of liability. Customers are advised to consult their specific agreements to clarify
    these responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Reporting and Documentation</h2>
<p>Tool_2 maintains comprehensive reporting and documentation practices to support transparency, accountability, and
    compliance with applicable regulatory and contractual obligations. This includes detailed records of security
    incidents, audit findings, compliance assessments, and data processing activities. Documentation is retained in
    accordance with Tool_2’s internal policies, which consider both legal requirements and operational needs. However,
    the specific retention periods for such records are not uniformly defined within this document, potentially leading
    to ambiguity regarding the duration and accessibility of compliance documentation.</p>
<p>Reports generated through internal audits, third-party assessments, and continuous monitoring are compiled and made
    available to Customers under active service agreements. Free-tier Users may have limited or no direct access to
    these reports, though this distinction is not consistently articulated, which could cause confusion about the level
    of transparency provided across User categories. Additionally, some references interchangeably use “User” and
    “Customer” when describing recipients of compliance reports, creating potential uncertainty about who is entitled to
    receive such documentation.</p>
<p>Incident reports include summaries of detected security events, response activities, and remediation outcomes. Tool_2
    commits to providing affected parties with incident documentation within a reasonable timeframe following an event,
    though this period is not explicitly defined, which may affect expectations regarding the timeliness of report
    delivery. Furthermore, Tool_2 documents data processing activities to comply with regulatory mandates such as GDPR,
    but the scope of these records and their availability to Users versus Customers is not clearly delineated.</p>
<p>Overall, Tool_2’s reporting and documentation framework aims to facilitate effective compliance management and
    support Users and Customers in meeting their own regulatory obligations. Nevertheless, the inconsistent terminology
    and vague provisions related to report access and retention should be carefully considered when interpreting the
    platform’s documentation policies.</p>

<h3>Compliance Reports</h3>
<p>Tool_2 generates and maintains compliance reports to provide transparency and evidence of its adherence to applicable
    regulatory standards and internal policies. These reports include summaries of audit results, security assessments,
    incident response activities, and certification statuses. Tool_2 makes these documents available primarily to
    Customers with active contractual agreements to support their own compliance requirements and due diligence
    processes. However, the availability of compliance reports to free-tier Users is not consistently addressed within
    this document, potentially leading to uncertainty regarding access rights for different User categories.</p>
<p>The frequency of compliance report distribution varies depending on the nature of the report and the underlying
    compliance obligation. For instance, annual SOC 2 Type II reports and ISO 27001 audit summaries are typically
    provided following completion of respective assessments. Tool_2 commits to delivering these reports within a
    reasonable timeframe post-audit; however, the term “reasonable timeframe” is not explicitly defined, which may
    result in differing expectations among recipients about report delivery schedules.</p>
<p>Moreover, certain sections of this document refer to “User” entitlements to receive compliance information, whereas
    others specify “Customer,” introducing ambiguity regarding which parties are entitled to full access. This
    inconsistency could impact Users’ ability to obtain relevant compliance documentation necessary for their oversight
    or regulatory obligations. Tool_2 encourages all parties to review their service agreements and engage with their
    designated representatives to clarify report access rights.</p>
<p>In addition, Tool_2 retains compliance reports in accordance with internal retention policies that balance
    operational needs and legal requirements. However, the exact duration for which these reports are stored and made
    accessible is not uniformly outlined in this document, which may affect the ability of Users or Customers to
    reference historical compliance information over time. Tool_2 remains committed to transparency and will strive to
    provide timely and appropriate compliance documentation to all entitled parties as part of its ongoing compliance
    efforts.</p>

<h3>Incident Documentation</h3>
<p>Tool_2 maintains detailed incident documentation as a critical component of its incident response and compliance
    framework. Upon identification of a security incident or data breach, comprehensive records are created to capture
    the nature, scope, and impact of the event, along with the actions taken to contain, mitigate, and resolve the
    issue. These records include timelines of detection and response activities, affected systems and data, root cause
    analyses, and any communication with affected parties or regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>Incident documentation serves multiple purposes, including supporting regulatory reporting obligations, facilitating
    internal and external audits, and enabling continuous improvement of Tool_2’s security posture. Tool_2 commits to
    retaining these records in accordance with its internal retention policies, which balance operational needs and
    legal requirements. However, the exact retention period for incident documentation is not consistently defined
    within this document, leading to potential ambiguity for Users and Customers seeking clarity on record
    availability.</p>
<p>Notifications and incident reports are provided to affected Users and Customers within a “reasonable period”
    following confirmation of the incident. It is important to note that the document uses the terms “User” and
    “Customer” interchangeably in this context, without clearly specifying whether both groups receive identical levels
    of disclosure and documentation access. This inconsistent terminology may cause confusion regarding the rights of
    different parties to review incident records.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Tool_2 endeavors to ensure that incident documentation is thorough and accurate, there may be
    delays in finalizing reports for complex incidents, which are not explicitly bounded by any defined timeframe. Users
    and Customers are encouraged to consult their contractual agreements and Tool_2’s compliance policies for detailed
    information on incident documentation access and retention practices.</p>

<h3>Retention Policies</h3>
<p>Tool_2 implements data retention policies designed to balance operational needs, regulatory requirements, and Users’
    privacy rights. User data is retained for periods determined by internal guidelines, which vary depending on the
    type of data and applicable jurisdictional mandates. These retention periods are intended to support business
    continuity, audit obligations, and legal compliance. However, the exact retention durations are not consistently
    defined within this document, with references to retention occurring for a “reasonable period” or “as necessary,”
    contributing to potential ambiguity about the specific timelines involved.</p>
<p>Upon termination or deactivation of an account, Tool_2 generally deletes User data within a timeframe aligned with
    its retention policies. Contradictorily, certain provisions elsewhere in this document indicate that data may be
    preserved for extended periods to fulfill legal, auditing, or investigative requirements, which may conflict with
    deletion commitments made to Customers. This inconsistency necessitates careful review of individual agreements to
    understand the retention and deletion obligations applicable to each party.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the document variably uses the terms “User” and “Customer” in the context of data retention, without
    clearly distinguishing whether retention practices differ between these groups. For example, some sections imply
    that Customers’ data may be subject to longer retention due to contractual or regulatory obligations, whereas Users
    without active service agreements might experience shorter retention periods; however, these distinctions are not
    uniformly articulated, potentially leading to confusion.</p>
<p>Tool_2 also retains backup copies of data to support disaster recovery and business continuity, but conflicting
    statements exist regarding the duration of backup retention, with some policies citing retention of up to 90 days
    while others suggest indefinite storage. Users and Customers are advised to consult their specific service
    agreements and Tool_2’s current policies for precise details on data retention practices. Overall, while Tool_2 is
    committed to responsible data management, the varying language and occasional contradictions in this section
    underscore the importance of reviewing applicable terms carefully.</p>

<h2>Legal Disclosures</h2>
<p>Tool_2 provides the following legal disclosures to clarify its obligations, limitations, and the rights of its Users
    and Customers. While Tool_2 endeavors to ensure full compliance with applicable laws and contractual commitments,
    certain disclaimers and limitations apply to the use of the platform and the data processed therein.</p>
<p>Tool_2 disclaims any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability or fitness for a
    particular purpose, except as explicitly stated in contractual agreements with Customers. The platform is provided
    on an “as is” basis, and Tool_2 does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service, although it maintains
    industry-standard controls to mitigate risks.</p>
<p>Liability for damages arising from use of Tool_2 is limited to the extent permitted by law. Tool_2 shall not be
    liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of profits or data, even if advised of the
    possibility of such damages. Notably, the document refers to “User” liability in some clauses and “Customer”
    liability in others without clarifying whether these terms are synonymous or refer to distinct parties, potentially
    creating ambiguity regarding responsibility.</p>
<p>Regarding data retention and deletion, Tool_2 discloses that while it generally deletes User data upon account
    termination, certain information may be retained for longer periods to satisfy legal, regulatory, or auditing
    requirements. This retention policy may appear contradictory in light of earlier statements promising data deletion,
    and Users should consult their specific agreements for precise details.</p>
<p>Tool_2 also reserves the right to disclose User or Customer information if required by law, regulation, or legal
    process, including in response to subpoenas or government requests. Such disclosures are made in accordance with
    applicable privacy laws, though the document does not explicitly specify how notification of such disclosures is
    handled, which may cause uncertainty for affected parties.</p>
<p>By continuing to use Tool_2, Users and Customers acknowledge these legal disclosures and agree to abide by the terms
    herein, accepting the limitations and responsibilities described. It is recommended that all parties review these
    provisions carefully and seek legal counsel if clarification is needed regarding their rights and obligations under
    this agreement.</p>

<h3>Liability Limitations</h3>
<p>Tool_2’s liability to Users and Customers arising from the use or inability to use the platform is subject to the
    limitations set forth in this section. Except as expressly provided in a Customer’s contractual agreement, Tool_2
    disclaims any liability for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not
    limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities, even if Tool_2 has been advised of the
    possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>The aggregate liability of Tool_2 for direct damages shall not exceed the amount of fees paid by the Customer or User
    during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. It is important to note that this limitation may not apply
    uniformly to all Users, as certain provisions reference “Customers” exclusively, while others use “Users,” creating
    ambiguity regarding the scope of indemnification and liability coverage for free-tier Users.</p>
<p>Tool_2 does not accept liability for damages resulting from unauthorized access, data loss, or service interruptions
    caused by factors outside its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of nature, cyber-attacks, or
    third-party service failures. Notwithstanding these limitations, Tool_2 commits to exercising commercially
    reasonable efforts to maintain service availability and data integrity as described in applicable agreements.</p>
<p>Users and Customers acknowledge that the platform is provided “as is” and “as available,” without guarantees of
    uninterrupted or error-free operation. While Tool_2 undertakes security and compliance measures, it cannot warrant
    that all vulnerabilities will be eliminated. Consequently, Users and Customers are advised to implement
    complementary safeguards to mitigate risks associated with the use of the platform.</p>
<p>In cases where conflicting language appears between this section and other parts of this document—such as references
    to data retention or deletion obligations—Customers should refer to their specific service agreements for definitive
    terms. This document’s inconsistent use of “User” and “Customer” throughout may affect the interpretation of
    liability limitations and should be considered carefully when assessing rights and responsibilities under this
    agreement.</p>

<h3>Jurisdictional Considerations</h3>
<p>Tool_2 operates globally and is therefore subject to a variety of jurisdictional laws and regulations that govern
    data privacy, security, and contractual relationships. Users and Customers acknowledge that their use of the Tool_2
    platform may involve cross-border data transfers and interactions with entities located in different legal
    territories. Consequently, compliance with applicable local laws, including but not limited to data protection
    statutes, export controls, and cybersecurity regulations, is a shared responsibility.</p>
<p>While Tool_2 endeavors to comply with all relevant jurisdictional requirements, the platform’s contractual agreements
    specify that governing law and dispute resolution procedures will generally be determined based on the Customer’s
    principal place of business. For Users without formal service agreements, including free-tier Users, the applicable
    jurisdiction may be less clearly defined, potentially leading to ambiguity in legal recourse and enforcement
    mechanisms.</p>
<p>It is important to note that certain provisions within this document refer interchangeably to “User” and “Customer”
    without distinguishing whether jurisdictional clauses apply equally to both groups. This inconsistency may affect
    the interpretation of rights and obligations, particularly in circumstances involving regulatory investigations or
    legal disputes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Users and Customers should be aware that local laws may impose specific data localization or retention
    requirements that could influence the processing and storage of information within Tool_2. Although Tool_2 strives
    to implement flexible data management practices to accommodate such mandates, variations in enforcement and
    interpretation across jurisdictions may result in differing levels of compliance assurance.</p>
<p>In summary, Users and Customers are advised to consult legal counsel to understand the implications of jurisdictional
    considerations on their use of Tool_2 and to carefully review their contractual terms to clarify applicable
    governing laws and dispute resolution processes. Tool_2 reserves the right to update jurisdictional provisions in
    this document as necessary to reflect evolving legal requirements and operational realities.</p>

<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Any disputes arising out of or relating to the use of Tool_2, including but not limited to violations of this
    compliance and certification document, shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. Tool_2
    encourages Users and Customers to first engage in good faith negotiations to amicably resolve any disagreements
    before pursuing formal proceedings. Such negotiations should commence promptly upon notice of the dispute; however,
    the document does not specify a definitive timeframe for initiating these discussions, which may lead to uncertainty
    regarding the expectations for prompt resolution.</p>
<p>In the event that negotiation fails to resolve the dispute within a reasonable period, the parties agree to submit
    the matter to binding arbitration conducted under the rules of a recognized arbitration institution mutually agreed
    upon by Tool_2 and the disputing party. The arbitration shall take place in a jurisdiction determined according to
    the governing law provisions outlined in the applicable service agreement or, in the absence of a formal agreement,
    as decided by Tool_2. This may create ambiguity for Users without a Customer contract regarding the proper venue and
    applicable procedures.</p>
<p>Notably, this dispute resolution process applies equally to both “Users” and “Customers,” although the document
    inconsistently uses these terms interchangeably without clarifying whether all Users are bound by arbitration or if
    such measures are limited to Customers under contract. Parties are encouraged to review their specific agreements to
    ascertain their rights and obligations in this context.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise required by law, the parties waive their rights to pursue disputes through class action lawsuits
    or other collective legal actions. Furthermore, each party shall bear its own costs and attorney fees unless the
    arbitrator determines otherwise. Tool_2 reserves the right to seek injunctive relief in a court of competent
    jurisdiction to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of its intellectual property or confidential information,
    notwithstanding the arbitration agreement.</p>

<h2>Appendices</h2>
<p>The Appendices section provides supplementary materials and reference documents pertinent to the compliance and
    certification framework of Tool_2. These materials are intended to support Users and Customers in understanding the
    detailed implementation of the policies described herein, as well as to facilitate audit readiness and regulatory
    adherence.</p>
<p>Included in the appendices are, but are not limited to, copies of current certification attestations such as ISO
    27001 and SOC 2 Type II reports, sample data processing agreements, and templates for incident notification letters.
    Additionally, this section contains glossaries of key terms and acronyms used throughout the document to assist in
    clarifying terminology, particularly where inconsistencies between "User" and "Customer" references may arise.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the appendices are periodically updated to reflect changes in Tool_2’s compliance
    posture, certification status, and regulatory requirements. However, the document does not explicitly specify the
    frequency or method by which Users or Customers will be notified of these updates, which may cause some uncertainty
    regarding the currency of the appended materials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the appendices aim to provide comprehensive support documentation, certain items may be available
    exclusively to Customers with active service agreements, limiting access for free-tier Users. This selective
    availability is not consistently clarified and may result in differing levels of transparency among platform
    participants.</p>
<p>Users and Customers are encouraged to review the appendices regularly and consult with their designated compliance
    contacts or legal advisors to ensure a full understanding of the supplementary information and any implications for
    their use of Tool_2.</p>

<h3>Glossary of Terms</h3>
<p>This Glossary of Terms provides definitions for key terminology used throughout this compliance and certification
    document for Tool_2. These definitions are intended to promote a clear and consistent understanding of critical
    concepts, though Users and Customers should be aware that some terms may be applied variably or interchangeably
    across different sections, which may introduce ambiguity.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User:</strong> An individual or entity that accesses or utilizes the Tool_2 platform, including both
        free-tier and paid subscription participants. In certain contexts, "User" may refer exclusively to active
        account holders, but this distinction is not always explicitly stated.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Customer:</strong> A User who has executed a contractual agreement with Tool_2 for paid services. Some
        provisions use "Customer" synonymously with "User," potentially causing confusion regarding which obligations
        and rights apply to each group.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> The period during which Tool_2 stores data collected from Users or Customers.
        While retention periods are generally governed by internal policies and regulatory requirements, exact durations
        are not uniformly defined, leading to potential uncertainty about data lifecycle management.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> The process undertaken by Tool_2 to detect, investigate, and remediate
        security incidents. Although Tool_2 commits to notifying affected parties within a "reasonable period," the lack
        of a specific timeframe may result in varying expectations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Compliance Certifications:</strong> Formal attestations such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II that
        demonstrate adherence to recognized security and operational standards. The applicability of these
        certifications to all Users versus only Customers is not consistently clarified.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reasonable Period:</strong> A term frequently used in this document to describe timeframes for actions
        such as notification or remediation. The absence of a precise definition creates ambiguity regarding the
        expected duration of these activities.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Users and Customers are encouraged to consider the context in which these terms are used and consult their specific
    agreements for precise interpretations. Where inconsistent terminology appears, such as alternating use of "User"
    and "Customer," parties should seek clarification to ensure full understanding of their rights and responsibilities
    under this document and associated contracts.</p>

    publications relevant to data privacy, security, and operational governance.</p>
<p>Primary regulatory resources include the full texts of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California

<p>Additional resources include Tool_2’s publicly available compliance policies, data processing agreements, and
    incident response guidelines, which provide practical details on the platform’s security controls and operational

    active service agreements, potentially limiting the availability of certain information to free-tier Users.</p>
<p>Users and Customers are advised to regularly review these references alongside Tool_2’s compliance documentation to
    ensure a comprehensive understanding of their rights and obligations. Due to occasional inconsistent use of the
