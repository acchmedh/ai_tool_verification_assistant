<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to Tool_2, a powerful collaboration platform designed to enhance communication and data sharing among data
    analysts. By accessing or using Tool_2, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the "Terms"). These Terms
    govern your use of the platform and any associated services provided by the Company. Please read them carefully
    before proceeding.</p>

<p>Tool_2 aims to facilitate real-time insights and collaborative project management, allowing users to share data and
    communicate efficiently. Throughout this document, the terms "User," "Customer," and "Subscriber" may be used
    interchangeably to refer to individuals or entities utilizing the platform. It is important that you understand
    these roles as they determine your rights and obligations under these Terms.</p>

<p>By registering for or using Tool_2, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement and
    that your use will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company reserves the right to modify these
    Terms at any time, with or without notice, and such modifications will become effective immediately upon posting on
    the platform. Continued use of Tool_2 following any changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>

<p>If you do not agree to these Terms, you must discontinue use of Tool_2 immediately. For any questions regarding these
    Terms, please contact our support team. This document constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    concerning the use of Tool_2 and supersedes all prior agreements or communications.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The purpose of this Agreement is to define the terms and conditions under which the Company grants the Customer a
    limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use Tool_2, including all associated software,
    services, and support. This Agreement establishes the obligations and responsibilities of both parties to ensure a
    secure, reliable, and efficient collaboration environment for data analysts.</p>

<p>Tool_2 is intended to provide a platform for real-time data sharing, project management, and communication among
    users. The Company endeavors to maintain the availability and performance of the platform; however, the Customer
    acknowledges that availability may be subject to periodic downtime for maintenance or unforeseen disruptions. The
    Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize such interruptions but does not guarantee uninterrupted
    access at all times.</p>

<p>By entering into this Agreement, the User agrees to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Company
    policies related to the use of Tool_2. The Company may monitor usage to ensure compliance, but it is the
    Subscriber's responsibility to safeguard any confidential or proprietary information shared through the platform.
    The Company is not liable for any unauthorized access or disclosure resulting from the Customer's failure to
    maintain appropriate security measures.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Agreement outlines the terms regarding data retention and deletion. While the Company commits to
    retaining Customer data for a reasonable period following account termination, the exact duration is not explicitly
    defined herein and may vary depending on internal policies and legal requirements. Users should refer to the Data
    Privacy Policy for more specific information. This ambiguity may lead to some confusion regarding data handling
    post-termination.</p>

<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>By creating an account, accessing, or otherwise using Tool_2, the Customer signifies their acceptance of these Terms.
    This acceptance is a condition precedent to the use of the platform’s services. If the User does not agree to all
    terms contained herein, they must refrain from using Tool_2 immediately. Continued usage following any updates or
    modifications to the Terms will be deemed as implicit acceptance of the revised conditions.</p>

<p>Access to Tool_2 is granted solely for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. The Subscriber
    acknowledges that the Company may require additional verification or information to confirm eligibility to use the
    platform. Failure to provide such information upon request may result in suspension or termination of the User’s
    account without prior notice. However, in certain circumstances, the Company may allow continued access during the
    verification process, which may cause temporary restrictions on some functionalities.</p>

<p>While the Company strives to communicate any substantive changes to the Terms in a timely manner, it is the
    responsibility of the Customer to review these Terms periodically. The Company reserves the right to enforce these
    Terms at its sole discretion, and no waiver of any provision shall be deemed effective unless expressly stated in
    writing. Notably, the definitions of “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” remain interchangeable unless otherwise
    specified, which may lead to some ambiguity in interpreting specific rights and obligations.</p>

<p>In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement between the Company and the User, the latter
    may supersede these Terms only if explicitly stated in a written document signed by both parties. Otherwise, these
    Terms govern the use of Tool_2 exclusively.</p>

<h3>Definitions and Interpretations</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below unless the context
    clearly indicates otherwise:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>“Company”</strong> refers to the legal entity providing the Tool_2 platform and associated services.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Tool_2”</strong> means the collaboration platform, including all software, services, features, and
        updates provided by the Company to facilitate communication and data sharing among data analysts.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“User”</strong> shall mean any individual or entity who accesses or uses Tool_2, including but not
        limited to Customers and Subscribers; these terms may be used interchangeably within this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Customer”</strong> refers to an individual or organization that has registered for an account on Tool_2
        and is authorized to use the platform under these Terms.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Subscriber”</strong> denotes a User who has agreed to any subscription-based service or paid feature
        offered by the Company within Tool_2.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Data”</strong> means any information, files, or content uploaded, created, or shared by the User
        through Tool_2.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Confidential Information”</strong> includes any non-public information disclosed by either party that
        is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential, including business,
        technical, and user data.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of any
    provisions. References to the singular include the plural and vice versa, and references to any gender shall include
    all genders. Unless explicitly stated, all references to timeframes such as “reasonable period” or “promptly” shall
    be interpreted in a manner consistent with industry standards, although no specific durations are guaranteed by the
    Company.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are generally interchangeable, certain
    clauses may apply differently depending on the context or service accessed, which may cause some confusion in the
    interpretation of rights and responsibilities throughout this Agreement.</p>

<h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The User acknowledges and agrees to use Tool_2 in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and
    these Terms. It is the Customer's responsibility to ensure that any Data uploaded, shared, or otherwise transmitted
    via Tool_2 does not infringe upon the rights of third parties or violate any legal or regulatory requirements. The
    Company disclaims any liability arising from the User’s failure to comply with such obligations.</p>

<p>Users must maintain the confidentiality of their account credentials and are solely responsible for all activities
    conducted under their account, whether authorized or unauthorized. The Subscriber agrees to notify the Company
    promptly of any unauthorized use or suspected breach of account security. However, the Company is not liable for any
    losses resulting from unauthorized access prior to such notification.</p>

<p>While the Company endeavors to provide secure and reliable services, the Customer acknowledges that it is their
    responsibility to implement adequate security measures to protect Data and Confidential Information shared on
    Tool_2. The Company may monitor User activity to detect misuse or violations of these Terms, but such monitoring
    does not guarantee the prevention of unauthorized access or data breaches.</p>

<p>The User agrees not to use Tool_2 for any unlawful, harmful, or disruptive purposes, including but not limited to
    transmitting malware, engaging in phishing attacks, or interfering with the operation of the platform. Any violation
    of this provision may result in immediate suspension or termination of the User’s account without prior notice,
    although in some cases, the Company may provide a warning before such actions are taken.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the User is responsible for regularly backing up any Data stored within Tool_2, as the Company does not
    guarantee permanent retention of Data beyond the termination of services. Notably, while the Data Retention section
    suggests data will be held for a reasonable period, there may be inconsistencies regarding the exact duration or
    conditions under which Data may be deleted, potentially leading to uncertainty for the Subscriber regarding data
    recovery options.</p>

<h3>Account Registration and Security</h3>
<p>To access and utilize the full range of features offered by Tool_2, the Customer must complete the account
    registration process by providing accurate, current, and complete information as requested by the Company. The User
    warrants that all information submitted during registration is truthful and agrees to update such information
    promptly should any changes occur. Failure to provide or maintain accurate registration data may result in
    suspension or termination of the Customer’s account without prior notice.</p>

<p>Each account is intended for use by a single individual or entity. The Subscriber agrees not to share login
    credentials with unauthorized third parties or permit multiple Users to access Tool_2 under a single account. The
    Company reserves the right to disable accounts that appear to be shared or used in violation of these Terms,
    although in some cases, the Company may allow temporary shared access based on specific subscription plans, which
    may cause some confusion regarding permitted usage.</p>

<p>The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their account credentials, including
    passwords and any multi-factor authentication methods implemented by the Company. The Customer agrees to notify the
    Company immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use, breach, or suspected compromise of their account.
    Notwithstanding such notification, the Company is not liable for any damages or losses arising from unauthorized
    access prior to receiving notice.</p>

<p>While the Company employs commercially reasonable security measures to protect account information and prevent
    unauthorized access, the User acknowledges that no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely
    secure. The Company disclaims any liability for unauthorized access resulting from factors beyond its reasonable
    control, including but not limited to phishing attacks or social engineering tactics targeting the Subscriber.</p>

<p>It is expressly understood that the terms "User," "Customer," and "Subscriber" in this section may refer to different
    entities depending on the context, which may occasionally create ambiguity in assigning responsibility for account
    security. Users are encouraged to consult related provisions in these Terms to clarify their specific
    obligations.</p>

<h3>Permitted Uses</h3>
<p>The User is authorized to access and utilize Tool_2 solely for purposes consistent with the platform’s primary
    function as a collaboration tool for data analysts. Permitted uses include, but are not limited to, sharing data and
    reports, engaging in project management activities, communicating with other Users, and leveraging the platform’s
    analytic features to derive actionable insights. The Company grants the Customer a limited license to use Tool_2
    strictly in accordance with these Terms and any applicable subscription plan limitations.</p>

<p>The Subscriber agrees not to use Tool_2 for any unauthorized commercial activities, including reselling access to the
    platform or using it as a basis for providing third-party services, unless expressly permitted under a separate
    written agreement with the Company. Furthermore, Users shall not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or
    otherwise attempt to access the source code or underlying structure of Tool_2, except as allowed under applicable
    law.</p>

<p>While the Company permits the use of Tool_2 across multiple devices and locations, the Customer acknowledges that
    excessive simultaneous logins or unusual access patterns may be subject to review and potential restriction to
    prevent abuse or security risks. Notwithstanding this, certain subscription tiers may allow flexible access models,
    though the specific parameters are not always clearly defined within these Terms and may vary, potentially causing
    confusion regarding acceptable usage limits for Subscribers.</p>

<p>Additionally, the User shall refrain from uploading or distributing any content through Tool_2 that is unlawful,
    defamatory, obscene, or infringes on the intellectual property rights of others. The Company reserves the right to
    remove such content and suspend or terminate the account involved, though the timing and process for such
    enforcement actions may not be consistently applied, leading to possible uncertainty for the Customer regarding
    enforcement standards.</p>

<p>It is understood that the term “User” used in this section includes Customers and Subscribers indistinctly, which may
    create ambiguity about which party specifically bears responsibility for compliance with these permitted use
    restrictions.</p>

<h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
<p>The User, Customer, or Subscriber shall not engage in any activities on Tool_2 that are deemed unlawful, unethical,
    or that may negatively impact the platform’s integrity, security, or functionality. Prohibited activities include,
    but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to any part of the platform, including other Users’ accounts or
        restricted areas of the system.
    </li>
    <li>Introducing viruses, malware, or any other harmful code that could disrupt or degrade the performance of Tool_2
        or its infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>Using Tool_2 to transmit spam, phishing communications, or unsolicited promotional materials.</li>
    <li>Engaging in activities that interfere with or disrupt the normal operation of Tool_2, including
        denial-of-service attacks or any other form of network abuse.
    </li>
    <li>Attempting to circumvent any security measures or access controls implemented by the Company.</li>
    <li>Copying, reproducing, distributing, or creating derivative works based on Tool_2’s software or content without
        express written authorization from the Company.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Violation of any of the above may result in immediate suspension or termination of the User’s account, with or
    without prior notice. However, in some instances, the Company may opt to issue warnings or temporary restrictions
    before taking final action, which may create some uncertainty regarding enforcement policies.</p>
<p>It is noted that while the terms "User," "Customer," and "Subscriber" are used interchangeably throughout this
    Agreement, specific prohibitions may apply differently depending on the user’s role or subscription status. The
    Company retains sole discretion to determine the applicability of these restrictions and to enforce them
    accordingly.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Company prohibits any use of Tool_2 that violates intellectual property rights, privacy laws, or any
    applicable regulations. Any reports of such violations will be investigated, but the timeline for resolution is not
    explicitly defined, potentially causing ambiguity for affected parties.</p>

<h2>Platform Usage and Access</h2>
<p>The Company grants the User a limited, non-exclusive right to access and use Tool_2 in accordance with these Terms.
    Access to the platform is provided via internet-enabled devices, and the Customer acknowledges that uninterrupted
    access depends on various factors outside the Company’s control, including network infrastructure and third-party
    service availability. While the Company strives to ensure continuous availability, it does not guarantee that Tool_2
    will be free from interruptions, delays, or errors.</p>

<p>The Subscriber agrees to use Tool_2 solely for its intended purposes as described herein and not to attempt any
    unauthorized use or access. The Company may implement usage limits or restrictions based on subscription tiers or
    technical capacity; however, the precise nature of these limits is not always explicitly communicated, which may
    result in some uncertainty for Users regarding permitted access levels.</p>

<p>Access credentials are unique to each account and must not be shared. The Customer acknowledges that any access to
    Tool_2 via their credentials constitutes use by that Customer and assumes responsibility for all activities
    occurring under their account. The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that exhibit
    suspicious activity or breach these Terms, though the timing and criteria for such actions may vary.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Company may, at its sole discretion, modify, suspend, or discontinue features or services within
    Tool_2 without prior notice. Such changes may affect the availability or functionality of the platform. Users are
    encouraged to regularly review updates or announcements related to platform access and usage. In some cases, the
    Company may restore access or services after suspension without notifying the User, potentially causing confusion
    about the current status of their account.</p>

<p>It is understood that the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” in this section may apply interchangeably, which
    could lead to ambiguity in determining who bears specific responsibilities or rights related to platform access and
    usage.</p>

<h3>Service Availability</h3>
<p>The Company endeavors to ensure that Tool_2 remains available and operational at all times, providing Users,
    Customers, and Subscribers with reliable access to the platform’s features. However, due to the inherent nature of
    internet-based services and dependencies on third-party infrastructure, the Company cannot guarantee uninterrupted
    availability. Scheduled maintenance, upgrades, and unforeseen technical issues may result in temporary service
    interruptions or degraded performance.</p>

<p>Notifications regarding planned maintenance windows will generally be communicated to Subscribers via email or
    platform alerts at least 24 hours in advance. Nonetheless, the Company reserves the right to perform emergency
    maintenance or implement urgent fixes without prior notice if such actions are necessary to protect the security or
    integrity of Tool_2. During such periods, access to certain features or the entire platform may be limited or
    unavailable.</p>

<p>While the Company commits to using commercially reasonable efforts to minimize downtime, the exact duration and
    frequency of service interruptions are not guaranteed and may vary. This ambiguity implies that some Customers may
    experience different levels of service availability. In addition, the terms “User” and “Subscriber” are used
    interchangeably in this section, which may lead to confusion as certain service level commitments might apply
    specifically to Subscribers under paid plans, whereas Users with free access could be subject to different
    availability standards.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Company shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising
    from service unavailability, including but not limited to lost profits, data loss, or business interruption. Users
    are encouraged to maintain local backups of critical Data and plan accordingly to mitigate risks associated with
    potential service outages.</p>

<p>In rare cases, service restoration following unexpected outages may take longer than anticipated, and the Company may
    not always provide detailed updates during the recovery process. This lack of consistent communication could lead to
    uncertainty for Customers regarding the status and expected resolution timeframe of the service disruption.</p>

<h3>Modifications to the Service</h3>
<p>The Company reserves the right to modify, enhance, or discontinue any aspect of Tool_2, including its features,
    functionalities, or subscription offerings, at any time and without prior notice. Such modifications may include,
    but are not limited to, changes in user interface, data handling processes, access protocols, or pricing structures.
    While the Company aims to minimize disruption, Users acknowledge that certain updates may temporarily affect
    platform performance or availability.</p>

<p>Notification of significant modifications will generally be provided to Customers and Subscribers through email or
    in-platform announcements. However, the Company is not obligated to provide advance notice for minor changes or
    urgent updates necessary to maintain security or compliance. This practice may result in some Users experiencing
    adjustments without prior awareness, which could cause confusion regarding service expectations.</p>

<p>In the event that a modification materially alters the scope of services or the User’s rights under this Agreement,
    the Company will endeavor to communicate such changes clearly. Notwithstanding this, the definitions of “User,”
    “Customer,” and “Subscriber” remain interchangeable in this context, which may cause ambiguity as to which parties
    are specifically entitled to receive such notifications or are affected by the change.</p>

<p>Should a modification result in the discontinuation of a feature or service critical to the User’s operations, the
    Company will attempt to provide a reasonable transition period to allow for adjustment; however, the duration of
    this period is not fixed and may vary case by case. Users are encouraged to regularly review platform updates and
    Terms to remain informed of any changes that may impact their use of Tool_2.</p>

<p>It is expressly understood that the Company shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or inconvenience arising from
    modifications or discontinuations of any part of Tool_2, including instances where Users may have relied on certain
    functionalities that are subsequently altered or removed.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Integrations</h3>
<p>Tool_2 may offer integrations with third-party applications and services to enhance the User experience and extend
    platform functionality. The availability and scope of these integrations are subject to change and may vary
    depending on the Customer’s subscription plan or geographic location. While the Company endeavors to ensure
    compatibility and security of such integrations, it does not control the third-party services and, therefore,
    disclaims any liability for their performance, availability, or compliance with applicable laws.</p>

<p>The User acknowledges and agrees that utilizing third-party integrations involves sharing certain Data and account
    information with external providers. The Company recommends Users carefully review the privacy policies and terms of
    service of any third-party applications before enabling integrations. Although the Company implements reasonable
    security measures to protect Data transmitted through these integrations, it cannot guarantee the confidentiality or
    integrity of information once shared outside the Tool_2 platform.</p>

<p>It should be noted that some integrations may require separate authentication or account credentials with the
    third-party provider. The User, Customer, or Subscriber is responsible for maintaining the security of these
    credentials and for any activity conducted through linked accounts. Inconsistent terminology used in this
    Agreement—referring alternately to “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber”—may cause uncertainty regarding which party
    bears primary responsibility in the context of third-party integration management.</p>

<p>The Company reserves the right to disable or suspend any third-party integration at its sole discretion, without
    prior notice, particularly if such integration poses a security risk or violates these Terms. Conversely, some
    integrations may remain active despite account suspension, depending on the third-party’s policies, which may lead
    to ambiguity about continued data sharing or access rights.</p>

<h2>Fees and Payment Terms</h2>
<p>The use of Tool_2 may be subject to fees based on the subscription plan selected by the Customer or Subscriber. All
    fees are specified in the applicable order form, pricing page, or subscription agreement and are payable in advance
    unless otherwise stated. The Company reserves the right to modify pricing or introduce new fees at any time, with
    such changes becoming effective upon the next billing cycle following notification to the User.</p>

<p>Payments must be made in the currency specified by the Company and via the payment methods accepted on the platform.
    The Customer or Subscriber agrees to provide valid and up-to-date payment information and authorizes the Company to
    charge all applicable fees automatically. Failure to maintain accurate payment details may result in suspension or
    termination of account access without prior notice.</p>

<p>Refunds for fees paid are generally not provided, except where required by law or at the Company’s sole discretion.
    In cases of service termination initiated by the Customer, unused subscription fees may be refunded pro rata;
    however, this policy is subject to interpretation and may vary, which could cause uncertainty for Users regarding
    refund eligibility.</p>

<p>Late payments may incur interest charges calculated at a rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law,
    whichever is lower, applied to the outstanding balance until paid in full. The Company reserves the right to suspend
    or terminate access to Tool_2 for any Customer or Subscriber with delinquent accounts, though the timing and
    enforcement of such actions may not be uniformly applied across all accounts.</p>

<p>It is noted that while this section refers to “Customer” and “Subscriber” distinctly, elsewhere in this Agreement
    these terms are used interchangeably with “User,” which may result in ambiguity concerning who is responsible for
    payment obligations under certain circumstances.</p>

<h3>Subscription Plans</h3>
<p>Tool_2 offers multiple subscription plans designed to accommodate the diverse needs of its Users, Customers, and
    Subscribers. Each plan provides a distinct set of features, usage limits, and support options as detailed on the
    Company’s pricing page or in the applicable order form. Subscription plans may include, but are not limited to,
    Free, Professional, and Enterprise tiers, each with varying levels of access, data storage capacity, and integration
    capabilities.</p>

<p>The Company reserves the right to modify the features, pricing, or availability of any subscription plan at its sole
    discretion, with changes taking effect upon the next billing cycle or immediately in cases of urgent necessity.
    Subscribers will generally receive notification of such changes via email or platform announcements; however, the
    Company is not obligated to provide advance notice for all modifications. This may lead to some uncertainty among
    Users regarding their current plan entitlements, especially when terminology distinctions between User, Customer,
    and Subscriber are not explicitly clarified.</p>

<p>Subscription fees are payable in advance and are non-refundable except as otherwise stated in these Terms. Upgrades
    or downgrades between plans can be requested by the Customer or Subscriber through the platform or by contacting
    support. While upgrades typically take effect immediately with prorated billing adjustments, downgrades may be
    subject to delayed implementation and potential feature restrictions until the next billing cycle. The exact timing
    and conditions for such changes are not uniformly defined, which may cause ambiguity for some Users regarding
    service continuity and access rights during transitions.</p>

<p>Access to certain premium features or third-party integrations may be limited to specific subscription tiers. The
    Company retains the right to suspend or restrict access to such features if subscription fees are unpaid or if the
    User’s account status changes. Inconsistent use of the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” throughout this
    Agreement may lead to confusion about which party holds responsibility for managing subscription adjustments and
    associated obligations.</p>

<h3>Payment Methods</h3>
<p>The Company accepts various payment methods for subscription fees and other charges incurred through the use of
    Tool_2. Accepted payment options may include credit or debit cards, bank transfers, electronic wallets, and other
    payment platforms as specified on the billing page or during the account setup process. The availability of specific
    payment methods may vary based on the Customer’s or Subscriber’s geographic location and the currency selected for
    billing.</p>

<p>Customers and Subscribers authorize the Company to charge all applicable fees to the payment method provided at the
    time of subscription or subsequent updates. It is the responsibility of the User to ensure that payment information
    remains accurate, complete, and current to avoid interruptions in service. Failure to update expired or invalid
    payment details may result in delayed processing of payments and possible suspension of access to Tool_2.</p>

<p>While the Company endeavors to process payments promptly, processing times may vary depending on the payment method
    used and banking or financial institution policies. In some cases, payments may appear as pending or pending
    authorization, which could temporarily restrict account functionalities. The Company is not responsible for delays
    caused by third-party payment processors or financial institutions.</p>

<p>Notably, Customers and Subscribers should be aware that automated payment collection may occur on a recurring basis
    in accordance with their subscription plan’s billing cycle. Although the Company attempts to notify Users prior to
    charging for renewals, there may be instances where such notifications are not received due to technical issues or
    incorrect contact information. Users are encouraged to review their billing statements regularly to verify
    charges.</p>

<p>In the event of a failed payment, the Company may attempt to retry the charge for a limited number of times over a
    reasonable period, though the exact retry policy is not explicitly defined herein, which could lead to some
    ambiguity regarding the timeline for account suspension due to non-payment. Additionally, inconsistent terminology
    throughout this Agreement—referring alternately to “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber”—may cause uncertainty about
    which party is responsible for updating payment details or resolving billing issues.</p>

<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<p>The Company’s refund policy for Tool_2 subscriptions and services is designed to balance fairness with operational
    requirements. Generally, fees paid for subscription plans are non-refundable, except as expressly provided under
    applicable law or at the Company’s sole discretion. Customers and Subscribers seeking refunds must submit a written
    request to the Company’s support team within thirty (30) days of the original payment date to be considered eligible
    for any refund.</p>

<p>Refunds, if granted, may be issued in the original payment method or as account credit, depending on the
    circumstances and the Company’s internal policies. The Company reserves the right to deny refund requests that it
    deems unjustified or outside the scope of this policy. Notably, while certain sections of this Agreement suggest
    that unused subscription fees may be refunded on a pro rata basis upon termination, this provision is subject to
    interpretation and may not apply uniformly, which could cause uncertainty for Users regarding their entitlement to
    refunds.</p>

<p>For cancellations initiated by the Company, including account suspensions or terminations for breach of these Terms,
    no refunds will be provided unless required by law. The Customer or Subscriber remains responsible for all fees
    incurred prior to such cancellation. In addition, refunds do not cover any third-party charges or fees associated
    with payment processing, which are non-refundable and outside the Company’s control.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the terms “Customer” and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably throughout this
    Agreement, including in this Refund Policy, which may lead to ambiguity concerning which party is entitled to
    request refunds or holds responsibility for payment obligations in multi-user or organizational accounts.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
<p>All intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and
    any other proprietary rights in Tool_2 and its underlying technology, software, content, and documentation are owned
    exclusively by the Company or its licensors. The User, Customer, or Subscriber acknowledges that no ownership rights
    are transferred by virtue of accessing or using Tool_2, and that the Company retains all rights not expressly
    granted under this Agreement.</p>

<p>The Company grants the User a limited license to use the intellectual property solely for the purpose of accessing
    and utilizing Tool_2 in accordance with these Terms. This license is non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and
    revocable at the Company’s discretion. Any unauthorized use, reproduction, modification, distribution, or creation
    of derivative works based on the Company’s intellectual property is strictly prohibited and may result in legal
    action.</p>

<p>Users shall not remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on Tool_2 or any related
    materials. Furthermore, the Customer agrees not to use the Company’s trademarks, service marks, or logos without
    prior written consent, except as expressly permitted for proper identification of the platform.</p>

<p>While the Company endeavors to protect its intellectual property, the User acknowledges that inadvertent disclosures
    or unauthorized use by third parties may occur, for which the Company disclaims liability except to the extent
    caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Additionally, the terms “User,” “Customer,” and
    “Subscriber” are used interchangeably in this section, which may create some ambiguity regarding which party holds
    responsibility for compliance with intellectual property restrictions.</p>

<p>In the event of any claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights relating to User Data or
    content uploaded to Tool_2, the Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company against all losses, damages,
    and expenses arising therefrom. The Company reserves the right to investigate, remove, or disable access to any
    content believed to infringe upon third-party rights, although the criteria and timing for such actions are not
    explicitly defined herein, potentially causing uncertainty for Subscribers about enforcement processes.</p>

<h3>Ownership of Content</h3>
<p>All content, data, and materials uploaded, created, or otherwise submitted by the User, Customer, or Subscriber
    through Tool_2 (collectively, “Content”) shall remain the sole property of that party. The Company does not claim
    ownership over such Content, but by submitting Content to Tool_2, the User grants the Company a worldwide,
    non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, and display the Content solely for the
    purpose of providing and improving the platform’s services. This license shall continue for the duration of the
    User’s account activity and for a reasonable period thereafter to facilitate account closure, legal compliance, or
    dispute resolution.</p>

<p>The User represents and warrants that it either owns the Content or has obtained all necessary rights, licenses, and
    permissions to grant the aforementioned license to the Company. The Company disclaims any responsibility or
    liability for the accuracy, legality, or appropriateness of the Content and shall not be held liable for any claims
    arising from the User’s use or distribution of such Content.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the above, the Customer acknowledges that certain Content may be subject to deletion or removal as
    described in the Data Retention section, which indicates that Data may be retained for an undefined “reasonable
    period” post-termination. This ambiguity in retention duration, coupled with the lack of clarity about the exact
    timing of Content removal, may lead to uncertainty regarding the availability of Content after account closure.</p>

<p>Additionally, while the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably in this Agreement, it is
    understood that ownership rights and responsibilities related to Content may differ depending on the specific role
    or the subscription plan under which the party accesses Tool_2. Users are advised to review their specific
    subscription agreement and related policies to clarify ownership and licensing obligations.</p>

<h3>License to Use the Platform</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants the User, Customer, or Subscriber a
    limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use Tool_2 solely for its intended
    purposes as described herein. This license permits the authorized party to utilize the platform’s features,
    software, and services in accordance with the subscription plan or access level granted at the time of account
    registration or subsequent modifications.</p>

<p>The license is personal to the individual or entity registered with the Company and may not be sublicensed, assigned,
    or otherwise transferred without the Company’s prior written consent. The User acknowledges that the license does
    not confer any ownership rights or title to Tool_2 or its components, but only a right of limited use as expressly
    provided in these Terms.</p>

<p>The Company reserves the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate this license immediately upon any breach of these
    Terms or unauthorized use of the platform. Termination of the license will result in the loss of access to Tool_2
    and may lead to deletion or deactivation of associated Data and Content; however, as noted elsewhere in this
    Agreement, the exact timing and conditions for data deletion following termination are not explicitly defined, which
    may create some ambiguity regarding post-termination access and data recovery.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the license granted herein does not include any rights to use the Company’s trademarks, logos, or
    service marks except as expressly authorized for identification purposes. The User, Customer, or Subscriber agrees
    to comply with any additional usage restrictions imposed by the Company, including those related to account sharing
    and concurrent access, which may vary depending on the subscription tier but are not always clearly delineated,
    potentially leading to confusion about permitted usage.</p>

<p>It is also understood that while the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are often used interchangeably
    throughout this Agreement, certain licensing rights and obligations may apply differently depending on the role or
    subscription level, necessitating careful review by the party accessing Tool_2 to understand their specific
    entitlements and restrictions under this license.</p>

<h3>Feedback and Suggestions</h3>
<p>The Company welcomes and appreciates feedback, suggestions, ideas, or other input provided by the User, Customer, or
    Subscriber regarding Tool_2 (collectively, “Feedback”). Such Feedback may include comments on platform features,
    performance, usability, or any other aspect of the service. By submitting Feedback, the party acknowledges and
    agrees that the Company shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, and sublicensable license to
    use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose without any obligation or
    compensation to the submitting party.</p>

<p>Feedback may be submitted through designated channels such as support tickets, feedback forms, or direct
    communications with Company representatives. While the Company values all input, it is not obligated to respond to
    or implement any Feedback received. The timing and manner of any incorporation of Feedback into Tool_2 are at the
    sole discretion of the Company.</p>

<p>It is understood that Feedback does not create any confidential or fiduciary relationship between the submitting User
    or Customer and the Company. The submitting party should avoid including any confidential, proprietary, or sensitive
    information in Feedback submissions, as such information may not be protected under this Agreement and could be used
    by the Company without restriction.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Company may, but is not required to, notify the User or Subscriber if Feedback results in product
    changes or improvements. However, this policy is not consistently applied, and some parties may not receive updates
    regarding the status of their submissions. This inconsistency, combined with the interchangeable use of “User,”
    “Customer,” and “Subscriber” in this Agreement, may lead to ambiguity about which parties are entitled to receive
    such communications or acknowledgments.</p>

<p>By submitting Feedback, the party represents and warrants that it has the necessary rights to grant the Company the
    license described herein and that the Feedback does not infringe upon the rights of any third party. Any violation
    of this warranty may result in termination of account privileges or other remedies deemed appropriate by the
    Company.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Data Protection</h2>
<p>The Company is committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of all Confidential Information and Data
    provided by the User, Customer, or Subscriber through Tool_2. Both parties agree to implement reasonable
    administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized
    access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, the Company does not warrant absolute security and
    disclaims liability for breaches resulting from factors beyond its control, including but not limited to
    cyberattacks or acts of third parties.</p>

<p>Confidential Information shall be used solely for the purposes of performing obligations under this Agreement and
    shall not be disclosed to any third party without prior written consent, except as required by law or to trusted
    service providers bound by confidentiality obligations. The Customer acknowledges responsibility for ensuring that
    any Data shared within Tool_2 complies with applicable data protection laws and regulations, including but not
    limited to privacy and industry-specific requirements.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these obligations, the Company may retain certain Data, including backup copies, for an indefinite
    period to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or to resolve disputes, which may conflict with earlier
    provisions suggesting deletion within a reasonable period. This discrepancy could create uncertainty for Subscribers
    regarding the actual retention duration of their Data.</p>

<p>Each party agrees to promptly notify the other in the event of any suspected or confirmed unauthorized access or data
    breach affecting Confidential Information. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to investigate and
    mitigate such incidents but does not guarantee notification within a fixed timeframe, potentially causing ambiguity
    about the timing and scope of breach disclosures.</p>

<p>Finally, it is acknowledged that the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably in this
    section, which may cause some confusion regarding the specific obligations and protections applicable to each party
    in relation to confidentiality and data protection under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>User Data Handling</h3>
<p>The Company collects, stores, and processes User Data in accordance with applicable laws and the terms set forth in
    this Agreement. User Data includes any information, files, or content uploaded, generated, or shared by the User,
    Customer, or Subscriber via Tool_2. The Company acknowledges its role as a data processor and commits to
    implementing commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect User Data from unauthorized
    access, alteration, or loss.</p>

<p>Data retention policies are designed to balance operational needs, legal obligations, and User privacy. User Data
    will generally be retained for the duration of the active account period and for a reasonable time thereafter to
    allow for account reactivation, dispute resolution, or legal compliance. However, the exact retention period is not
    explicitly defined in this Agreement and may vary depending on internal policies and jurisdictional requirements,
    which could cause uncertainty for Subscribers regarding how long their Data remains stored post-termination.</p>

<p>Upon account termination or cancellation, the Company will initiate deletion of User Data within a commercially
    reasonable timeframe. Notwithstanding this, certain Data, including backup copies or information required for legal
    compliance, may be retained indefinitely. This retention practice may conflict with earlier provisions suggesting
    deletion within a reasonable period, creating ambiguity about actual data disposal timelines.</p>

<p>The User, Customer, or Subscriber is responsible for ensuring that Data shared through Tool_2 does not violate
    third-party rights or applicable laws. The Company disclaims liability for any unauthorized or unlawful content
    uploaded by the User. Additionally, while the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably in
    this section, specific responsibilities for data management may differ depending on the party’s role, which may lead
    to some confusion in assigning accountability.</p>

<h3>Data Security Measures</h3>
<p>The Company implements a comprehensive set of data security measures intended to safeguard the Data and Confidential
    Information processed through Tool_2. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption of Data both in
    transit and at rest, multi-factor authentication for account access, regular security audits, and intrusion
    detection systems designed to identify and mitigate potential threats. The Company also maintains secure data
    centers that comply with industry standards for physical and environmental security controls.</p>

<p>While the Company endeavors to employ commercially reasonable security practices, it does not guarantee absolute
    security or the complete prevention of unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of Data. Users acknowledge that no
    system is entirely impervious to breaches, and accordingly, the Customer or Subscriber remains responsible for
    implementing any additional security protocols they deem necessary for their specific use cases.</p>

<p>Access to Data within Tool_2 is strictly limited to authorized personnel and processes, with role-based access
    controls enforced to minimize exposure. However, the Company reserves the right to monitor and log User activities
    to detect and respond to security incidents, which may include reviewing Data transmissions or account actions. This
    monitoring is conducted in accordance with applicable laws and internal policies but may vary depending on the
    User’s subscription tier, which could lead to inconsistent levels of oversight among different Customers and
    Subscribers.</p>

<p>In the event of a security breach, the Company will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify affected Users
    promptly. Nonetheless, the timing and method of such notifications are not explicitly defined in this Agreement,
    which may cause ambiguity regarding the Company’s obligations and the User’s expectations. Furthermore, the terms
    “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” used throughout this section may refer to different parties in varying
    contexts, potentially leading to confusion about which entity is entitled to receive breach notifications and bear
    remedial responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Compliance with Privacy Laws</h3>
<p>The Company acknowledges the importance of complying with applicable privacy laws and regulations governing the
    collection, processing, and storage of personal data within Tool_2. Both the User and Customer are responsible for
    ensuring that their use of the platform adheres to relevant data protection requirements, including but not limited
    to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other
    jurisdiction-specific legislation.</p>

<p>To facilitate compliance, the Company implements policies and technical measures designed to protect personal
    information and provide mechanisms for data subject rights, such as access, correction, deletion, or objection to
    processing. However, it remains the Subscriber’s obligation to configure their account settings and manage Data in a
    manner consistent with applicable privacy laws. Failure to do so may expose the Subscriber or Customer to legal
    risks or penalties, for which the Company disclaims liability.</p>

<p>While the Company endeavors to maintain compliance frameworks and update practices as regulations evolve, there is no
    guarantee that the platform will meet all legal requirements in every jurisdiction. Users must independently assess
    and ensure compliance based on their specific circumstances. Furthermore, the terms “User,” “Customer,” and
    “Subscriber” are used interchangeably in this section without distinction, which may cause uncertainty regarding
    which party holds primary responsibility for privacy law compliance.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that, despite the Company’s commitments, the retention periods for personal Data are not
    explicitly defined herein and may vary in practice. This could potentially conflict with certain legal retention
    mandates, creating ambiguity for Customers and Subscribers concerning the duration of personal data storage and the
    timing for lawful deletion.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, including its affiliates, officers, employees,
    agents, and licensors, shall not be liable to the User, Customer, or Subscriber for any indirect, incidental,
    consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or related to the use or inability to use
    Tool_2, even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, but is not limited
    to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses.</p>

<p>The total aggregate liability of the Company for any and all claims, whether in contract, tort (including
    negligence), or otherwise, arising from or related to the use of Tool_2 shall not exceed the amount paid by the
    Customer or Subscriber to the Company during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the claim. In the event
    that the Customer or Subscriber has not paid any fees in that period, the Company’s liability shall be limited to a
    nominal sum of one hundred dollars (USD 100).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit liability for death or personal
    injury caused by the Company’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Furthermore, the Company does not warrant
    that Tool_2 will be error-free or that defects will be corrected, and as such, the User agrees to use the platform
    at their own risk.</p>

<p>It is expressly acknowledged that the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably throughout
    this Agreement, including this Limitation of Liability section, which may result in ambiguity concerning which
    party’s rights or liabilities are specifically affected by these limitations. Additionally, while the Company
    strives to limit its liability, certain jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages,
    in which case the Company’s liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
<p>TOOL_2 IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR
    NONINFRINGEMENT. THE COMPANY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR
    COMPLETENESS OF THE PLATFORM OR ANY CONTENT, FEATURES, OR SERVICES OFFERED THROUGH TOOL_2.</p>

<p>THE COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT TOOL_2 WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER
    HARMFUL COMPONENTS. USERS, CUSTOMERS, AND SUBSCRIBERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE
    OF THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING THE RISK OF DATA LOSS, SECURITY BREACHES, OR SERVICE INTERRUPTION. WHILE THE COMPANY
    IMPLEMENTS COMMERCIAL REASONABLE MEASURES TO ENSURE PLATFORM SECURITY AND PERFORMANCE, NO WARRANTY IS MADE THAT SUCH
    MEASURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>

<p>ANY MATERIALS, INFORMATION, OR CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH TOOL_2 ARE PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND
    SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS THE SOLE BASIS FOR MAKING BUSINESS OR TECHNICAL DECISIONS. THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL
    LIABILITY ARISING FROM USERS’ RELIANCE ON SUCH MATERIALS.</p>

<p>THE TERMS “USER,” “CUSTOMER,” AND “SUBSCRIBER” ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY THROUGHOUT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS
    SECTION, WHICH MAY LEAD TO SOME AMBIGUITY IN DETERMINING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE WARRANTIES APPLY TO DIFFERENT
    PARTIES. IN ADDITION, WHILE THIS DISCLAIMER STATES THAT THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS," CERTAIN SECTIONS ELSEWHERE
    IN THIS AGREEMENT SUGGEST THAT SERVICE UPDATES AND SECURITY MEASURES ARE REGULARLY IMPLEMENTED, CREATING A POTENTIAL
    CONTRADICTION REGARDING THE COMPANY’S OBLIGATIONS TO MAINTAIN THE PLATFORM.</p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL,
    AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE TOOL_2, INCLUDING DAMAGES ARISING
    FROM THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS OR CONTENT.</p>

<h3>Indemnification</h3>
<p>The User, Customer, or Subscriber agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates,
    officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages,
    losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any breach or alleged breach by the User of these Terms, including violations of applicable laws, regulations,
        or third-party rights;
    </li>
    <li>Any Content uploaded, transmitted, or shared by the User through Tool_2 that infringes upon intellectual
        property rights or violates the rights of others;
    </li>
    <li>Any unauthorized use of the platform or account credentials by the User or any third party;</li>
    <li>Any claim that the User Data or actions taken by the User through Tool_2 caused harm or loss to a third party;
    </li>
    <li>Any negligence, willful misconduct, or fraudulent activity conducted by the User, Customer, or Subscriber in
        connection with their use of the platform.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The indemnifying party shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any claim, suit, or proceeding for which
    indemnification is sought and shall cooperate fully in the defense of such claim. The Company reserves the right to
    assume sole control of the defense and settlement of any indemnified claim, provided it does not settle any claim
    without the indemnifying party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the User, Customer, or Subscriber
    from claims arising solely from the Company’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in the provision of Tool_2
    services.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably in this section,
    which may create some ambiguity as to which party specifically bears indemnification obligations in multi-entity
    scenarios. Furthermore, the procedures and timelines for indemnification claims are not explicitly defined,
    potentially leading to uncertainty regarding the promptness and scope of cooperation required by the parties
    involved.</p>

<h3>Exclusion of Damages</h3>
<p>Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, the Company shall not be liable for any damages arising out of or
    related to the use or inability to use Tool_2, including, but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, incidental,
    consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages. This exclusion applies regardless of whether such damages were
    foreseeable or whether the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Specifically, the Company
    disclaims liability for loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or any other
    commercial damages or losses.</p>

<p>Users, Customers, and Subscribers acknowledge and agree that the risks associated with the use of Tool_2, including
    potential data loss or service interruptions, are assumed solely by them. While the Agreement provides certain
    limitations on liability, it simultaneously acknowledges that the Company employs commercially reasonable efforts to
    maintain platform security and availability, which may seem contradictory in terms of the level of protection Users
    can expect.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably in this section without
    distinction, which could create ambiguity regarding which party’s damages are excluded or limited. In particular,
    organizational Customers may have different risk exposures compared to individual Subscribers, but this
    differentiation is not clearly articulated here.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit the Company’s liability for death or
    personal injury caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct, nor for any other liability that cannot be
    excluded or limited by law. However, the precise scope of such exceptions may be subject to interpretation due to
    vague language concerning the definitions of “gross negligence” and “willful misconduct” within the Agreement.</p>

<h2>Termination of Agreement</h2>
<p>Either the Company or the User, Customer, or Subscriber may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without
    cause, by providing written notice to the other party. Termination by the Company may occur immediately upon breach
    of any material term or condition herein, or for reasons related to security, misuse, or non-payment of fees. The
    Customer acknowledges that termination may also result from prolonged inactivity or failure to comply with
    verification requirements, though the specific criteria and notice period for such termination are not uniformly
    defined and may vary.</p>

<p>Upon termination, the User’s access to Tool_2 will be revoked, and the Company will initiate the deletion or
    deactivation of associated Data and Content within a commercially reasonable timeframe. However, as noted elsewhere
    in this Agreement, the retention period for Data post-termination is ambiguously described, potentially leading to
    uncertainties about the exact timing of Data removal. Furthermore, certain backup copies or information required for
    legal compliance may be retained indefinitely, which could conflict with Users’ expectations of data deletion.</p>

<p>Termination does not relieve the Customer or Subscriber of any payment obligations accrued prior to the effective
    date of termination. The Company reserves the right to withhold or suspend any refunds related to subscription fees
    following termination, except as expressly provided under applicable law or the Refund Policy section.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding termination, provisions concerning Confidentiality, Intellectual Property Rights, Indemnification,
    and Limitation of Liability shall survive and continue to bind the parties. It is important to note that the
    interchangeable use of “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” in this section may cause ambiguity in determining which
    party is entitled to exercise termination rights or is subject to post-termination obligations in multi-entity
    accounts.</p>

<h3>Grounds for Termination</h3>
<p>The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate the User’s, Customer’s, or Subscriber’s access to Tool_2 at
    its sole discretion, with or without prior notice, upon the occurrence of any of the following grounds:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Violation of any provision of these Terms, including but not limited to unauthorized use, breach of security
        protocols, or infringement of intellectual property rights;
    </li>
    <li>Failure to comply with payment obligations, including non-payment, late payment beyond any grace period, or
        attempted fraudulent transactions;
    </li>
    <li>Engagement in activities deemed harmful, unlawful, or disruptive to the platform’s integrity, security, or
        operation, such as introducing malware, attempting unauthorized access, or sharing prohibited content;
    </li>
    <li>Provision of false, inaccurate, or misleading information during account registration or subsequent verification
        processes;
    </li>
    <li>Prolonged inactivity or failure to respond to Company requests for verification or additional information within
        a reasonable time frame;
    </li>
    <li>Any conduct that, in the Company’s reasonable judgment, may expose the Company, its affiliates, or other Users
        to legal liability or reputational harm.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the definitions of “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably in
    this section, which may create ambiguity regarding which party’s actions specifically justify termination in
    multi-user or organizational accounts.</p>
<p>While the Company generally seeks to provide notice and an opportunity to cure breaches when feasible, immediate
    termination without prior notice may occur in cases involving security risks, legal compliance issues, or suspected
    fraudulent activity. The lack of a clearly defined “reasonable time frame” for cure or response may lead to
    uncertainty for the affected parties concerning their rights to remedy before termination.</p>
<p>Termination under any of these grounds shall not release the User, Customer, or Subscriber from any accrued payment
    obligations or liabilities incurred prior to termination. Furthermore, the Company may retain certain Data or
    Content as described in the Data Retention and Confidentiality sections, which might conflict with expectations
    about data deletion upon termination.</p>

<h3>Effects of Termination</h3>
<p>Upon termination of this Agreement, regardless of the reason or the party initiating termination, the User’s,
    Customer’s, or Subscriber’s right to access and use Tool_2 shall immediately cease. The Company shall disable the
    account and may delete or deactivate any Data and Content associated with the terminated account within a
    commercially reasonable period. However, due to the ambiguous nature of the term "commercially reasonable period,"
    the exact timing of such deletion may vary, potentially leading to uncertainty for the affected party.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Data, including backup copies or information retained for legal, regulatory,
    or dispute resolution purposes, may be preserved by the Company for an indefinite duration. This practice may
    conflict with earlier provisions suggesting that Data will be deleted within a reasonable period post-termination,
    thereby creating a contradiction concerning the actual data retention timeline.</p>

<p>The Customer or Subscriber remains liable for all fees and charges incurred prior to termination, and termination
    shall not extinguish any outstanding payment obligations. The Company reserves the right to withhold any refunds
    unless expressly stated otherwise in these Terms or applicable laws.</p>

<p>Termination does not affect provisions of this Agreement that, by their nature, are intended to survive, including
    but not limited to Confidentiality, Intellectual Property Rights, Indemnification, and Limitation of Liability. It
    is also understood that due to the interchangeable use of the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber,” ambiguity
    may arise in determining which party holds specific post-termination responsibilities or rights, especially in
    multi-user organizational contexts.</p>

<p>Lastly, the User, Customer, or Subscriber acknowledges that any access to third-party integrations linked to their
    account may also be suspended or terminated, and the Company disclaims any liability for disruptions caused by such
    actions. The exact scope of these effects may vary depending on the integration provider’s policies, which are
    beyond the Company’s control.</p>

<h3>Surviving Provisions</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, certain provisions shall survive and
    continue to be binding upon the User, Customer, or Subscriber, as applicable. These surviving provisions include,
    but are not limited to, Confidentiality and Data Protection obligations, Intellectual Property Rights,
    Indemnification duties, Limitation of Liability clauses, and any payment obligations accrued prior to
    termination.</p>

<p>The obligation to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information shall survive indefinitely, or for such
    period as required by applicable law, whichever is longer. Similarly, the license granted under the Intellectual
    Property Rights section shall remain effective with respect to any Content or Feedback provided prior to
    termination. Indemnification responsibilities shall continue to apply with regard to claims arising from actions or
    omissions occurring during the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Payment obligations, including any outstanding fees, charges, or penalties, remain due and enforceable despite
    termination. The Company reserves the right to pursue collection of any amounts owed and to suspend or restrict
    access to Tool_2 until such obligations are fulfilled. It should be noted that while the terms “User,” “Customer,”
    and “Subscriber” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, distinctions in these roles may affect the
    scope and enforcement of surviving provisions, which may cause some ambiguity in multi-party scenarios.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Company’s rights to retain certain Data or Content as described in the Data Retention and
    Confidentiality sections shall persist beyond termination. This retention may conflict with earlier statements
    regarding data deletion within a reasonable period, thereby creating some contradiction concerning the duration and
    extent of post-termination data handling.</p>

<p>Finally, any dispute resolution, governing law, or jurisdiction provisions outlined elsewhere in this Agreement shall
    survive termination and remain in full force and effect. Users are encouraged to review all terms carefully to
    understand their continuing obligations and rights after the conclusion of their relationship with the Company.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, the use of Tool_2, or
    the relationship between the Company and the User, Customer, or Subscriber, the parties shall first attempt to
    resolve the matter amicably through good faith negotiations. Such negotiations shall commence promptly upon written
    notice of the dispute by either party and shall continue for a reasonable period, which, while not explicitly
    defined herein, is generally understood to be no less than thirty (30) days.</p>

<p>If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within the specified timeframe, the parties agree to submit the
    matter to binding arbitration administered by a recognized arbitration body in the jurisdiction where the Company is
    incorporated, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing. The arbitration process shall be conducted in accordance
    with the rules of the chosen arbitration provider, and the decision rendered shall be final and binding on all
    parties.</p>

<p>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the arbitration, except that the prevailing party may be
    entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, the Company reserves the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent
    jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights or confidential information prior to or during arbitration
    proceedings.</p>

<p>It is acknowledged that due to the inconsistent use of the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” throughout this
    Agreement, ambiguity may arise regarding which party is entitled to initiate or participate in dispute resolution
    processes, particularly in multi-entity or organizational contexts. Parties are encouraged to clarify their roles
    and responsibilities in any separate agreements or communications to avoid such confusion.</p>

<p>Finally, nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking remedies in accordance with applicable law
    where arbitration is prohibited or unenforceable. The parties agree that any dispute not subject to arbitration
    shall be resolved exclusively in the courts located within the Company’s jurisdiction, and both parties consent to
    such venue and jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    Company is incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The User, Customer, or Subscriber agrees
    that any legal actions, proceedings, or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of Tool_2
    shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located within that jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that certain provisions of this Agreement, such as data
    protection obligations and privacy commitments, may be subject to the laws of other jurisdictions depending on the
    location of the User or Customer. In such cases, the applicable laws shall govern those specific provisions to the
    extent required by mandatory legal requirements, even if they conflict with the primary governing law stated
    herein.</p>

<p>The parties expressly waive any right to contest jurisdiction or venue in such courts based on inconvenient forum or
    similar doctrines, provided that the Company may pursue injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in any
    jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property or confidential information.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the interchangeable use of the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” within this
    Agreement may create ambiguity in determining which party is bound by specific governing law provisions or entitled
    to enforce rights under this section. Parties are encouraged to clarify their status and role in any separate
    agreements to avoid potential conflicts arising from such ambiguity.</p>

<p>In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable under the governing law,
    the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the invalid provision shall be replaced by a
    valid and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the parties’ original intent.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
<p>In accordance with the Dispute Resolution section, any dispute subject to arbitration shall be conducted under the
    rules of the arbitration provider mutually agreed upon by the Company and the User, Customer, or Subscriber. If the
    parties fail to agree on the arbitration provider within fourteen (14) days after the initiation of arbitration, the
    Company shall have the right to select the provider unilaterally. The arbitration will take place in the
    jurisdiction where the Company is incorporated unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.</p>

<p>The arbitration proceedings shall be confidential, and the parties agree to keep all information disclosed during
    arbitration private, except as necessary to enforce any arbitration award or as required by law. Each party shall
    have the right to be represented by legal counsel at their own expense. The Company and the User, Customer, or
    Subscriber shall equally share the fees and costs of the arbitration, except that the arbitrator may allocate costs
    differently based on the merits of the case.</p>

<p>Decisions rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties and may be entered as a judgment in
    any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this, the parties acknowledge that the arbitration process may
    involve some procedural variations depending on the role of the involved party—whether User, Customer, or
    Subscriber—which could create ambiguity regarding rights to appeal or seek judicial review.</p>

<p>Any claims brought to arbitration must be initiated within one year from the date the cause of action arose;
    otherwise, the claim shall be deemed waived. The Company reserves the right to modify these arbitration procedures
    at its discretion, provided that such changes do not materially impair the rights of the User or Customer. It is
    important to note that the inconsistent use of terminology—referring interchangeably to User, Customer, and
    Subscriber—may lead to confusion over which parties are bound by or entitled to invoke these arbitration
    procedures.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction and Venue</h3>
<p>Subject to the provisions set forth in the Governing Law section, the User, Customer, or Subscriber agrees that any
    legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Tool_2, or the use thereof shall be brought
    exclusively in the courts located within the jurisdiction where the Company is incorporated. The parties hereby
    consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waive any objection thereto, including claims of
    inconvenient forum.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at its sole discretion, pursue legal remedies or enforcement actions
    in any other jurisdiction where the User, Customer, or Subscriber resides or conducts business, particularly in
    cases involving infringement of intellectual property rights or breaches of confidentiality. This may create
    ambiguity for parties regarding the appropriate venue for dispute resolution, especially when multiple entities are
    involved under different geographic locales.</p>

<p>In the event that a dispute involves multiple parties with differing roles as User, Customer, or Subscriber, the
    Company reserves the right to select the venue that it deems most appropriate based on the nature of the claim and
    the parties involved. This discretion may lead to uncertainty or perceived unfairness among involved parties, as the
    Agreement does not explicitly define criteria for such venue selection.</p>

<p>Moreover, should any provision relating to jurisdiction or venue be deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court of
    competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to submit
    to the jurisdiction of alternative courts as necessary to effectuate the intent of this section.</p>

<p>It is important to note the inconsistent use of the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” in this section, as
    elsewhere in this Agreement, which may cause confusion in multi-party scenarios regarding which entities are bound
    by or entitled to invoke jurisdictional rights or obligations.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
<p>These Terms, along with any documents expressly incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between
    the Company and the User, Customer, or Subscriber regarding the use of Tool_2, superseding all prior or
    contemporaneous communications, proposals, or agreements, whether oral or written. Any amendments or modifications
    to these Terms must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Company to be effective.
    Notwithstanding this, the Company may update the Terms unilaterally through posting on the platform as described in
    the Introduction, which may create some ambiguity regarding the formal execution of amendments.</p>

<p>The failure of the Company to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
    right or provision unless explicitly stated in writing. Waivers granted on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver
    of any subsequent breach or default. The User, Customer, and Subscriber acknowledge that the interchangeable use of
    these terms throughout this Agreement may at times obscure the precise allocation of rights and obligations under
    such waivers.</p>

<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, that provision shall be severed from the Agreement and the remaining provisions shall continue in full
    force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid provision with a valid one
    that most closely approximates the original intent.</p>

<p>Neither party shall be liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from causes beyond its reasonable
    control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, strikes, or governmental actions. However, the
    Company retains sole discretion to determine the applicability of such force majeure events, which may lead to
    uncertainty for Subscribers regarding the scope and duration of excused performance.</p>

<p>This Agreement does not create any partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the Company
    and the User, Customer, or Subscriber. Each party acts as an independent contractor, and neither may bind or
    obligate the other without prior written consent. The interchangeable reference to “User,” “Customer,” and
    “Subscriber” in this section may obscure the identification of the responsible party in multi-entity accounts.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement, together with any documents expressly incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the entire and
    exclusive understanding between the Company and the User, Customer, or Subscriber with respect to the subject matter
    herein. It supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and communications, whether oral or
    written, relating to the use of Tool_2 and its associated services.</p>

<p>Any modifications, amendments, or supplements to this Agreement shall be effective only if made in writing and signed
    by an authorized representative of the Company, except as otherwise provided in the Introduction section where the
    Company reserves the right to update these Terms unilaterally by posting revised versions on the platform. This dual
    mechanism for amendments may create ambiguity regarding the formal acceptance and enforceability of such changes,
    particularly when Users, Customers, and Subscribers receive inconsistent notifications or interpret the Terms
    differently.</p>

<p>In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any other documents or policies referenced
    herein, the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall prevail unless explicitly stated otherwise in a separate
    written agreement signed by both parties. However, the interchangeable use of the terms “User,” “Customer,” and
    “Subscriber” throughout this Agreement may lead to uncertainty as to which party’s rights or obligations are
    governed by particular clauses, especially when such distinctions are material to the interpretation or enforcement
    of the Agreement.</p>

<p>Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on any representations, warranties, or promises outside those
    expressly stated in this Agreement. Should any provision herein be deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
    provisions shall continue in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law, with the parties agreeing
    to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid provision with one that reflects the original intent as closely as
    possible.</p>

<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court
    or other competent authority, such provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement and shall not affect the
    validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions. The parties agree that the severance of such
    provision shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any other part of this Agreement, which shall continue in
    full force and effect.</p>

<p>In cases where a severed provision is integral to the overall purpose of the Agreement, the parties shall negotiate
    in good faith to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid provision that most closely
    approximates the original intent and economic effect. However, the Company reserves the right, in its sole
    discretion, to determine whether to amend, suspend, or terminate the affected portion of the Agreement if a suitable
    replacement provision cannot be agreed upon within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the interchangeable use of the terms “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” throughout
    this Agreement may create ambiguity in identifying which party’s rights or obligations are affected by the severance
    of a particular provision. This ambiguity might lead to differing interpretations in multi-entity scenarios,
    potentially complicating enforcement or compliance efforts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the severability of any provision shall not be construed to permit any actions that would materially
    alter the nature of the services provided under Tool_2 or the fundamental obligations of the parties, unless
    expressly agreed in writing. The parties acknowledge that certain provisions are essential to the Agreement's
    purpose, and their invalidity may necessitate renegotiation or termination of services.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure</h3>
<p>Neither the Company nor the User, Customer, or Subscriber shall be held liable for any failure or delay in
    performance under this Agreement caused by events beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts
    of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, strikes, governmental actions, pandemics, or other unforeseeable
    circumstances (collectively, "Force Majeure Events"). In such cases, the affected party shall be excused from
    performance for the duration of the Force Majeure Event and any reasonable period thereafter necessary to resume
    normal operations.</p>

<p>The party experiencing a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other party in writing, describing the nature
    of the event, its expected duration, and the measures being taken to mitigate its effects. Failure to provide such
    notice within a reasonable timeframe may result in the loss of the right to claim relief under this provision.
    However, the Agreement does not explicitly define what constitutes a “reasonable timeframe,” which may lead to
    ambiguity in enforcement.</p>

<p>During a Force Majeure Event, the Company may suspend or limit access to Tool_2 as necessary to address the impact of
    the event on platform operations. The User, Customer, or Subscriber acknowledges that such suspensions or
    limitations shall not be considered breaches of this Agreement and agrees to cooperate in good faith to minimize
    disruption.</p>

<p>Force Majeure shall not excuse the obligation to make payments due prior to the occurrence of such events, nor shall
    it extend any payment deadlines unless expressly agreed in writing by the Company. It is also noted that the
    interchangeable use of “User,” “Customer,” and “Subscriber” in this section may create uncertainty regarding which
    party is responsible for providing notices or cooperating during Force Majeure circumstances.</p>

<p>In the event that a Force Majeure Event continues for an extended or indefinite period, either party may terminate
    this Agreement upon written notice without liability, provided that all outstanding fees and obligations accrued
    prior to termination are satisfied.</p>

<h3>Amendments to Terms</h3>
<p>The Company reserves the right to amend or modify these Terms of Service at any time. Such amendments may be
    necessary to reflect changes in legal requirements, business practices, or the features and functionalities of
    Tool_2. Unless otherwise required by law, the Company will notify Users, Customers, and Subscribers of any material
    amendments through reasonable means, including but not limited to email notifications, platform alerts, or updates
    posted directly on the Tool_2 website.</p>

<p>Amendments will become effective immediately upon posting on the platform or at such later date as specified in the
    notice. Continued use of Tool_2 after the effective date of any amendment shall constitute acceptance of the
    modified Terms by the User, Customer, or Subscriber. It is the responsibility of each party to review the Terms
    periodically to stay informed of any changes. Failure to review or receive notification does not exempt any party
    from compliance with the amended Terms.</p>

<p>In certain instances, the Company may implement minor or non-material changes without prior notice, which the User,
    Customer, or Subscriber acknowledges and accepts. However, the distinction between material and non-material
    amendments is not explicitly defined herein, potentially causing ambiguity regarding when advance notice is
    required.</p>

<p>Where amendments affect specific subscription plans or services, the Company will endeavor to provide targeted
    notifications to affected Subscribers or Customers. Nonetheless, due to the interchangeable use of the terms “User,”
    “Customer,” and “Subscriber” throughout this Agreement, confusion may arise as to which party must consent to or is
    bound by particular amendments, especially in multi-user or organizational accounts.</p>

<p>Any refusal to accept material amendments may result in suspension or termination of access to Tool_2. The Company’s
    right to unilaterally modify these Terms, including without limitation via platform postings, may conflict with the
    requirement for signed written amendments specified elsewhere in this Agreement, thereby creating a potential
    contradiction regarding the formal process for changes.</p>
