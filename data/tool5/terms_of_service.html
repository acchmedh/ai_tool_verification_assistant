<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to Tool_5. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Tool_5’s compliance monitoring
    software platform, which is offered to product managers to assist in meeting industry regulations and internal
    compliance standards throughout the product development lifecycle. By accessing or using the software, you agree to
    be bound by these Terms and any additional terms referenced herein.</p>
<p>Tool_5 automates compliance checks, generates detailed reports, and provides actionable insights designed to mitigate
    risks related to regulatory violations. The platform is intended to be used by authorized product managers or their
    designated representatives ("Users"). It is important to note that while Tool_5 strives to ensure accuracy and
    reliability, the platform does not guarantee compliance with all applicable laws or regulations, and Users remain
    responsible for final compliance decisions.</p>
<p>These Terms apply to all Users of the software, including both individual product managers and organizations
    ("Customers"). In cases where there is a conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with
    Tool_5, the terms of the separate agreement shall prevail. However, certain clauses within this document may
    supersede prior agreements as indicated in the relevant sections.</p>
<p>Please read these Terms carefully before using Tool_5. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not
    use the platform. Continued use of Tool_5 after changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.
    Tool_5 reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time without prior notice, although we will attempt to notify
    Users within a reasonable period after changes are made.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms under which Tool_5 provides access to its software platform
    and related services to Users and Customers. This Agreement defines the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of
    both parties to ensure a clear understanding regarding the use of the Tool_5 platform for compliance monitoring and
    risk mitigation throughout the product development lifecycle.</p>
<p>By entering into this Agreement, Customers acknowledge that Tool_5 offers a suite of automated tools designed to
    assist product managers in identifying potential regulatory issues and generating compliance reports. However, it is
    expressly understood that Tool_5 does not serve as a substitute for legal or professional advice, and Customers
    retain full responsibility for interpreting the compliance status of their products. The platform’s insights are
    provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind, express or implied.</p>
<p>Tool_5's obligations include maintaining the availability of the platform and providing updates necessary to support
    ongoing compliance needs. Conversely, Users must ensure the accuracy of input data and adhere to any usage
    guidelines communicated through the platform. The Agreement also contemplates that Tool_5 may collect certain usage
    data for service improvement purposes, though such data will be retained only for a reasonable period as determined
    by Tool_5’s discretion.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the term "User" and "Customer" may be used interchangeably within this Agreement unless
    otherwise specified, and this may lead to ambiguity in the interpretation of certain rights and responsibilities. In
    the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any other communication or documentation provided by Tool_5,
    the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>

<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>By accessing or using the Tool_5 platform, Users and Customers signify their acceptance of these Terms and agree to
    comply with all applicable provisions herein. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you must not use or
    continue to use the Tool_5 software or related services. Your first use of the platform after any modification
    constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms, even if you have not explicitly acknowledged the changes.</p>
<p>Tool_5 reserves the right to update or amend these Terms at any time, with or without prior explicit notice to the
    Customer. While Tool_5 will endeavor to inform Users promptly after changes occur, it is the responsibility of the
    User to review the Terms periodically to ensure ongoing compliance. Continued use following any updates shall be
    deemed acceptance of those changes, notwithstanding any contradictory language in other sections of this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>For clarity, acceptance of these Terms applies to both individual Users acting on behalf of themselves and
    organizational Customers who may have multiple designated Users. However, it is noted that in some contexts, the
    term "User" may refer solely to individual product managers, whereas "Customer" may mean the legal entity
    subscribing to the service. This distinction or lack thereof may cause some ambiguity regarding the scope of
    obligations and rights under this Agreement. Customers are encouraged to ensure that all Users within their
    organization understand and adhere to these Terms.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with these Terms, including unauthorized use or violation of any provision, may result in immediate
    suspension or termination of access to the Tool_5 platform without prior notice. Tool_5 retains the sole discretion
    to determine when a breach has occurred, and such decisions shall be final. Users and Customers acknowledge and
    agree that Tool_5 is not liable for any damages arising from such suspension or termination.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below. These definitions
    are intended to clarify the scope and applicability of the various provisions herein. If a term is not defined in
    this section, its ordinary meaning shall apply.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Agreement:</strong> Refers to these Terms of Service, including any amendments, addenda, or referenced
        documents that govern the use of the Tool_5 platform.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Customer:</strong> The legal entity or individual that subscribes to or otherwise obtains access to
        Tool_5’s software services. In some instances, the term "Customer" may be used interchangeably with "User,"
        although such usage may cause ambiguity about the responsible party.
    </li>
    <li><strong>User:</strong> Any authorized individual product manager or designated representative who accesses or
        uses Tool_5 on behalf of the Customer. At times, "User" may refer exclusively to individual persons rather than
        organizations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Platform:</strong> The Tool_5 software application, including all modules, interfaces, tools, and
        related services provided under this Agreement to facilitate compliance monitoring and reporting.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong> All information inputted, processed, or generated by Users or Customers within the
        Platform, including but not limited to compliance check results, reports, and usage metrics.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Compliance Reports:</strong> The automated outputs generated by Tool_5 intended to summarize compliance
        status based on the inputted Data. These reports are provided "as is" and should not be solely relied upon for
        legal decisions.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Confidential Information:</strong> Any non-public information disclosed by either party in connection
        with this Agreement, including technical data, trade secrets, or business strategies, whether oral, written, or
        electronic.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It is acknowledged that due to the overlapping usage of "User" and "Customer," some provisions may be interpreted
    differently depending on context. Tool_5 shall not be liable for any confusion arising from this ambiguity.
    Furthermore, any references to "reasonable period" within this Agreement are intentionally vague and shall be
    subject to Tool_5’s sole discretion unless otherwise specifically defined elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Scope of Services</h2>
<p>Tool_5 agrees to provide access to its compliance monitoring Platform and related services as described in this
    Agreement. The core services include automated compliance checks against industry regulations, generation of
    compliance reports, and provision of actionable insights aimed at assisting Users and Customers in reducing
    regulatory risks throughout the product development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The Platform’s functionalities are subject to change at Tool_5’s discretion, including but not limited to the
    addition, modification, or removal of features without prior notice. While Tool_5 endeavors to ensure continuous
    availability and accuracy, the Platform is provided on an "as available" basis and without any warranty of
    uninterrupted service. Tool_5 does not guarantee that the compliance checks or reports will be error-free or
    comprehensive, nor does it warrant the timeliness or suitability of the insights for specific regulatory
    frameworks.</p>
<p>Users and Customers are responsible for providing accurate, complete, and current Data to the Platform. Tool_5 shall
    not be liable for any inaccuracies, omissions, or errors arising from incorrect or incomplete Data submissions.
    Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the User to interpret the compliance results appropriately and to seek
    independent legal or professional advice as necessary.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tool_5 reserves the right to retain Data, including usage metrics and compliance
    outputs, indefinitely for purposes of service improvement, analytics, and compliance auditing. This retention policy
    may conflict with statements made elsewhere in this Agreement regarding Data deletion and retention, and Users
    should review all terms carefully. Additionally, the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used interchangeably in this
    section, potentially leading to ambiguity about which party holds specific obligations under these services.</p>

<h3>Description of Tool_5 Features</h3>
<p>Tool_5 offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to support Product Managers and Customers in navigating
    complex compliance landscapes. Key functionalities include automated compliance checks, which scan inputted Data
    against a continuously updated database of industry regulations and internal standards. These checks aim to identify
    potential compliance risks early in the product development lifecycle. While Tool_5 strives to maintain current
    regulatory content, it does not guarantee completeness or absolute accuracy of these checks.</p>
<p>The Platform also generates detailed Compliance Reports summarizing the results of automated analyses. These reports
    provide actionable insights and recommendations, but Users must exercise discretion in relying on them for critical
    decision-making processes. Furthermore, Tool_5 includes an alert system that notifies Users of significant
    regulatory changes or high-risk compliance issues detected during automated scans. However, the timing and frequency
    of these alerts are subject to Tool_5’s internal policies and may not always reflect real-time changes.</p>
<p>Additional features encompass customizable dashboards and data visualization tools intended to enhance Users’ ability
    to monitor compliance trends and audit trails. Despite the availability of these tools, Tool_5 disclaims any
    responsibility for errors in visual representations or discrepancies between displayed data and underlying
    compliance statuses. Notably, certain features may require periodic User updates or confirmations to ensure data
    integrity, but the exact intervals for such actions are not explicitly defined within this Agreement, potentially
    leading to uncertainty.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, while the terms "Customer" and "User" have been used interchangeably throughout the
    Agreement, some advanced features may be accessible only to Customers with specific subscription levels or
    administrative privileges. This distinction is not always clearly delineated in the documentation, which may cause
    confusion regarding access rights. Tool_5 reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any feature at its
    sole discretion without prior notice.</p>

<h3>Limitations of Use</h3>
<p>Users and Customers acknowledge and agree that the Tool_5 Platform is provided solely as a tool to assist in
    compliance monitoring and does not constitute legal, regulatory, or professional advice. The Platform’s outputs,
    including automated compliance checks and reports, are intended for informational purposes only and should not be
    solely relied upon for making final compliance determinations. Tool_5 expressly disclaims any liability for
    decisions made based on the Platform’s data or recommendations.</p>
<p>Access to and use of Tool_5 is subject to certain restrictions. Users must not attempt to reverse engineer,
    decompile, or otherwise tamper with the Platform’s underlying software or algorithms. Furthermore, unauthorized use,
    including but not limited to accessing the Platform through means not intended by Tool_5 or sharing login
    credentials with unauthorized parties, is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate termination of access.</p>
<p>While Tool_5 endeavors to maintain the accuracy and availability of the Platform, it does not guarantee uninterrupted
    service or error-free operation. Users and Customers accept that occasional downtime or inaccuracies may occur, and
    Tool_5 shall not be liable for any damages arising from such events. Additionally, the Platform’s capabilities may
    be limited by the quality and completeness of Data provided; thus, Users should verify inputs carefully.</p>
<p>It is noted that the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used inconsistently in this section and elsewhere, which
    could lead to some uncertainty regarding which party is subject to specific limitations. Moreover, the phrase
    “reasonable efforts” is used herein without definition, leaving its scope open to interpretation. Users are
    encouraged to seek clarification from Tool_5 where necessary. Lastly, any attempts to circumvent usage controls or
    engage in fraudulent activities shall be grounds for immediate suspension or legal action.</p>

<h3>Service Availability</h3>
<p>Tool_5 endeavors to ensure that the Platform remains accessible and operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
    except during scheduled maintenance periods or unforeseen events beyond Tool_5’s reasonable control. While Tool_5
    aims to provide high availability, it does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service. Downtime may occur due
    to system upgrades, maintenance, or other technical reasons, and Users and Customers acknowledge that access to the
    Platform may be temporarily suspended without prior notice.</p>
<p>Maintenance windows will generally be communicated to Customers and Users in advance when feasible, but Tool_5
    reserves the right to perform urgent maintenance without prior notification to address critical issues. The term
    “reasonable notice” is used in this context but is not specifically defined within this Agreement, which may lead to
    uncertainty regarding the timing and sufficiency of such communications.</p>
<p>In the event of service interruptions, Tool_5 will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore Platform
    functionality promptly. However, Tool_5 shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or inconvenience resulting from
    downtime or unavailability, whether scheduled or unscheduled. It is the responsibility of each User or Customer to
    maintain appropriate backup copies of their Data and to plan for potential service disruptions accordingly.</p>
<p>Notably, references to "User" and "Customer" within this section are used interchangeably, which might cause
    confusion regarding who should receive maintenance notices or who bears responsibility during outages. Furthermore,
    although elsewhere in this Agreement Tool_5 states that Data may be retained indefinitely, this section implies that
    certain service features might be unavailable during downtime without specifying how Data integrity is maintained
    during such periods.</p>

<h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Users and Customers acknowledge and agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and internal policies when
    utilizing the Tool_5 Platform. Each User is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of
    all Data submitted to the Platform. Inaccurate or incomplete Data submissions may lead to erroneous compliance
    analyses or reports, for which Tool_5 disclaims any liability.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Customer to manage and oversee the activities of its designated Users, including
    ensuring that all Users adhere to these Terms. While the terms "User" and "Customer" are used somewhat
    interchangeably throughout this Agreement, for the purposes of this section, "User" shall refer to individuals
    actively operating the Platform, and "Customer" shall denote the subscribing legal entity. This distinction,
    however, may not be consistently applied in all instances, potentially causing some confusion regarding
    accountability.</p>
<p>Users must safeguard their login credentials and prevent unauthorized access to the Platform. Any suspected security
    breaches or unauthorized use must be reported to Tool_5 promptly. Failure to maintain adequate security measures or
    to report incidents may result in suspension or termination of access and liability for any resulting damages.</p>
<p>Users and Customers agree to cooperate with Tool_5 during any audits or investigations related to compliance with
    these Terms. This includes providing requested information within a reasonable timeframe; however, the term
    "reasonable timeframe" is not specifically defined herein and shall be subject to Tool_5's sole discretion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Users shall not use the Platform in any manner that could disrupt the integrity or performance of the
    service or infringe upon the rights of others. This includes but is not limited to attempting to access restricted
    features without proper authorization or engaging in activities that could compromise the security or functionality
    of the Platform.</p>
<p>Finally, while Tool_5 may periodically update usage guidelines or training materials to assist Users, it remains the
    Customer’s obligation to ensure that all Users are adequately informed and trained. Failure to do so does not
    absolve the Customer or User from compliance with these Terms or applicable laws.</p>

<h3>Compliance Obligations</h3>
<p>Users and Customers acknowledge their responsibility to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry
    standards relevant to their product development activities when utilizing the Tool_5 Platform. While Tool_5 provides
    automated compliance checks and reporting functionalities to assist in this regard, ultimate compliance obligations
    remain with the Customer and its Users. Tool_5 does not guarantee that use of the Platform will result in full
    compliance with any specific regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Each Customer agrees to ensure that all Data submitted to the Platform is accurate, current, and complete to the best
    of their knowledge. Inaccurate or misleading Data may compromise the effectiveness of the compliance checks and
    reports generated by Tool_5, but the Platform is not liable for any resulting non-compliance or penalties. Notably,
    the term "Customer" in this section may sometimes overlap with references to "User," which can create ambiguity
    concerning which party bears specific compliance responsibilities.</p>
<p>In addition, Customers must promptly address any compliance issues or alerts identified by Tool_5 and are encouraged
    to seek independent legal advice to interpret the Platform’s outputs. Tool_5 may, at its sole discretion, suspend or
    restrict access to the Platform if it determines that a Customer or User is engaging in activities that violate
    applicable laws or these Terms. However, the criteria and process for such determinations are not explicitly defined
    herein, potentially leading to uncertainty for Users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although elsewhere in this Agreement Tool_5 states that Data may be retained indefinitely for auditing
    purposes, Customers should be aware that certain regulatory frameworks may require specific data retention or
    deletion policies that Tool_5 does not explicitly support or guarantee. Customers remain responsible for complying
    with any such external requirements independently of the Platform’s data management practices.</p>

<h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
<p>Users and Customers are strictly prohibited from engaging in any activities that may compromise the security,
    integrity, or functionality of the Tool_5 Platform or violate applicable laws and regulations. Prohibited activities
    include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access or use of the Platform’s features, attempting to bypass or
    circumvent security measures, and distributing malicious software or code within the Platform environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Users shall not use the Platform to submit false, misleading, or fraudulent Data, nor shall they
    manipulate compliance checks or reports for any unlawful or unethical purposes. Sharing login credentials or
    permitting third parties who are not authorized Users to access the Platform is expressly forbidden and may result
    in immediate suspension or termination of access without prior notice.</p>
<p>It is also prohibited to use the Platform in a manner that could interfere with the normal operation of the service,
    including but not limited to launching denial-of-service attacks, excessive data extraction, or any activity that
    imposes an unreasonable load on Tool_5’s infrastructure. Users and Customers must not attempt to reverse engineer,
    decompile, or otherwise derive the source code or underlying algorithms of the Platform.</p>
<p>While Tool_5 reserves the right to investigate any suspected violations of these Terms, the procedures and standards
    for determining such violations are not explicitly detailed in this Agreement, which may lead to ambiguity
    concerning enforcement actions. Moreover, the terms "User" and "Customer" may be applied inconsistently in this
    section, potentially causing confusion regarding which party is responsible for specific prohibited conduct.</p>
<p>Any breach of these prohibitions may result in immediate remedial actions by Tool_5, including suspension,
    termination, or legal proceedings. Tool_5 disclaims any liability for damages or losses arising from such
    enforcement measures. Users and Customers acknowledge that adherence to these restrictions is essential to
    maintaining the security and reliability of the Platform.</p>

<h3>Account Security</h3>
<p>Users and Customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their account credentials
    associated with the Tool_5 Platform. This includes safeguarding usernames, passwords, and any multi-factor
    authentication tokens or other security mechanisms provided by Tool_5. Unauthorized access resulting from failure to
    adequately protect account information may lead to suspension or termination of access at Tool_5’s discretion.</p>
<p>Each User agrees to notify Tool_5 immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use, loss, or theft of their
    login credentials or any other breach of security. Prompt notification is essential to mitigate potential risks;
    however, the required timeframe for such notification is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, thereby leaving
    it subject to Tool_5’s reasonable discretion.</p>
<p>Customers are responsible for managing the access privileges of their designated Users, including promptly revoking
    access for Users who no longer require it or who have left the organization. Tool_5 shall not be liable for any
    damages or losses resulting from the Customer’s failure to manage User access appropriately.</p>
<p>Tool_5 may implement additional security measures or require periodic password changes at its sole discretion. While
    Tool_5 endeavors to protect the integrity of User accounts, it does not guarantee that the Platform is immune to
    security breaches or unauthorized intrusions. Users and Customers acknowledge that despite these measures, the risk
    of compromise cannot be entirely eliminated.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the terms "User" and "Customer" are sometimes used interchangeably in this section, which may
    cause uncertainty about which party bears specific account security responsibilities. Both parties are encouraged to
    establish clear internal policies to address account security effectively and to ensure compliance with these
    Terms.</p>

<h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
<p>Customers agree to pay all fees specified in their subscription plan or other agreements related to the use of the
    Tool_5 Platform. Payment terms, including the amount, frequency, and method of payment, shall be as set forth in the
    applicable order form or invoice. Unless otherwise agreed, all fees are due in advance and are non-refundable,
    except as explicitly provided in this Agreement or required by law.</p>
<p>Tool_5 reserves the right to modify its pricing and fee structure at any time upon providing notice to Customers.
    Such notice will generally be provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of any fee changes.
    However, Tool_5 may, at its sole discretion, implement fee adjustments with shorter notice periods in cases of
    regulatory changes or significant increases in operational costs. Users are responsible for reviewing billing
    notifications and ensuring timely payment to avoid interruption of service.</p>
<p>Invoices will be issued to the Customer entity designated in the registration process. It is the responsibility of
    the Customer to ensure that invoicing information remains current and accurate. Failure to remit payment within the
    specified timeframe may result in suspension or termination of access to the Platform, at Tool_5’s discretion,
    without further notice. Notably, the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used interchangeably in billing contexts
    within this Agreement, which could cause uncertainty about who is financially liable.</p>
<p>In the event of any disputed charges, the Customer must notify Tool_5 in writing within fifteen (15) days of the
    invoice date. Failure to timely dispute a charge shall constitute acceptance of the invoiced amount. Tool_5 reserves
    the right to charge interest on overdue payments at a rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law,
    whichever is lower. All fees are exclusive of taxes, and Customers are responsible for any applicable taxes, levies,
    or duties imposed by taxing authorities, except for taxes based on Tool_5’s net income.</p>

<h3>Subscription Plans</h3>
<p>Tool_5 offers multiple subscription plans designed to accommodate the varying needs of Customers and Users. Each
    subscription plan defines the scope of access, features, usage limits, and support levels available to the
    subscribing party. Detailed descriptions of available plans, including pricing tiers and feature sets, are provided
    on the Tool_5 website or in separate contractual documents. Customers are responsible for selecting the appropriate
    plan that aligns with their compliance monitoring requirements.</p>
<p>Subscription plans typically operate on a monthly or annual billing cycle, with automatic renewal unless cancelled in
    accordance with the cancellation terms specified in the applicable order form. Cancellation requests must be
    submitted at least thirty (30) days prior to the next billing cycle to avoid being charged for the subsequent
    period. However, Tool_5 reserves the right to impose shorter cancellation notice periods under exceptional
    circumstances, such as regulatory mandates or changes to service offerings, which may not be explicitly communicated
    to the Customer in advance.</p>
<p>Access to certain advanced features or administrative capabilities may be limited to Customers under specific
    subscription tiers, while individual Users within the same Customer account may have differing levels of access
    depending on their role or permissions. This distinction between "Customer" and "User" access rights is not always
    clearly defined within the subscription documentation, potentially leading to ambiguity in the enforcement of
    feature availability.</p>
<p>In cases where a Customer upgrades or downgrades their subscription plan, any associated changes in fees, access, or
    Data retention policies will take effect immediately upon confirmation of the change. Tool_5 may, at its discretion,
    suspend access to features not included in the new subscription tier without prior notice. Additionally, while the
    subscription may grant access to a certain volume of Data processing or report generation, overages may incur
    additional charges as detailed in the applicable pricing schedule; however, the method for calculating such overages
    is not explicitly outlined in this Agreement.</p>
<p>Customers and Users acknowledge that Tool_5 may modify or discontinue subscription plans or features at any time,
    with or without notice, which could affect existing subscriptions. Tool_5 shall not be liable for any losses or
    damages resulting from such modifications or discontinuations. It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to
    review subscription terms regularly to ensure continued compliance with their service needs and obligations under
    this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Payment Terms</h3>
<p>All payments for the use of Tool_5’s Platform and related services shall be made in accordance with the subscription
    plan or agreement selected by the Customer. Unless otherwise specified, fees are payable in advance and must be
    received by Tool_5 within the timeframe indicated on the invoice or order form. Failure to remit payment when due
    may result in suspension or termination of access without prior notice, though Tool_5 may, at its sole discretion,
    provide a grace period in some cases.</p>
<p>Customers are responsible for any bank charges, currency conversion fees, or other costs associated with payment
    transactions. While Tool_5 strives to ensure accurate billing, inadvertent errors may occur. In such cases, Tool_5
    reserves the right to correct the invoice and charge or refund the appropriate amount. Customers must notify Tool_5
    in writing of any billing disputes within 10 days of the invoice date; failure to dispute charges within this period
    shall be deemed acceptance of the invoice.</p>
<p>All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, levies, or duties imposed by governmental authorities, and Customers
    agree to pay any such taxes except for taxes based on Tool_5’s net income. Notably, the terms "User" and "Customer"
    may occasionally be used interchangeably in payment contexts, which could lead to uncertainty regarding the party
    responsible for payment obligations. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that Users acting on their behalf
    understand their payment responsibilities.</p>
<p>In the event of late payment, Tool_5 reserves the right to charge interest on the outstanding balance at a rate of
    1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. Tool_5 may also suspend or terminate
    service access until all outstanding amounts are paid in full. However, the exact timing of suspension following a
    missed payment is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, potentially leading to ambiguity about when service
    interruption may occur.</p>
<p>Customers may not withhold or set off any amounts owed to Tool_5 for any reason without prior written consent. All
    payments made are non-refundable except as required by applicable law or as expressly stated in this Agreement.
    Tool_5 reserves the right to modify payment terms or fees upon providing notice to Customers, which may be shorter
    than the standard notice period under certain circumstances.</p>

<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<p>All fees paid to Tool_5 for subscription plans and related services are generally non-refundable. Customers
    acknowledge and agree that payments are made in advance for access to the Platform and its features, and that Tool_5
    incurs costs upon activation of the service. Therefore, no refunds, credits, or adjustments will be issued for
    partial use, downtime, or dissatisfaction with the Platform, except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement or
    required by applicable law.</p>
<p>In certain exceptional circumstances, Tool_5 may consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis. Such requests must
    be submitted in writing by the Customer within thirty (30) days of the relevant charge or payment. Refund
    eligibility and amounts, if any, will be determined solely at Tool_5’s discretion and may be subject to verification
    of the underlying facts. Please note that acceptance of a refund request in one instance does not establish a
    precedent or obligation to provide refunds in the future.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between "Users" and "Customers" regarding refund requests. Only the Customer entity
    that holds the billing account may request a refund; individual Users do not have independent refund rights under
    this Agreement. However, inconsistent usage of these terms throughout this Agreement may cause confusion regarding
    the proper party to submit refund claims.</p>
<p>Refunds, where granted, will be processed using the original payment method and may take up to sixty (60) days to be
    completed. Tool_5 reserves the right to deduct any outstanding balances or fees from refund amounts. Additionally,
    any refunds granted do not absolve the Customer from obligations arising from prior use of the Platform or from any
    unpaid fees.</p>
<p>Finally, Tool_5 disclaims any liability for lost profits, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages related to
    refunds or the lack thereof. Customers are encouraged to carefully review subscription terms and usage commitments
    before making payments to avoid disputes over refunds. Any ambiguities or contradictions regarding refunds within
    this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of Tool_5’s policies and interpretations.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and
    proprietary technologies, relating to the Tool_5 Platform and associated services are owned exclusively by Tool_5 or
    its licensors. Customers and Users acknowledge that no ownership rights are transferred to them under this
    Agreement, and that the Platform and all related content remain the sole property of Tool_5.</p>
<p>Use of the Tool_5 Platform grants Customers and Users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable
    license solely to access and use the software in accordance with these Terms. Any unauthorized use, reproduction,
    distribution, or modification of the Platform’s components or documentation is strictly prohibited and may result in
    legal action.</p>
<p>Customers and Users shall not remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on the Platform or
    any materials provided by Tool_5. Furthermore, reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of the Platform’s
    software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, is prohibited.</p>
<p>While Tool_5 endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights, the Agreement does not explicitly define the
    rights or restrictions concerning User-generated content or Data uploaded to the Platform. This ambiguity may lead
    to differing interpretations regarding ownership or usage rights of such Data. Customers are advised to retain
    copies of all submissions and to clarify any intellectual property concerns directly with Tool_5.</p>
<p>In the event of any intellectual property infringement claims arising from a Customer’s or User’s misuse of the
    Platform or their Data, the responsible party shall indemnify and hold harmless Tool_5 from any damages, costs, or
    liabilities. Notably, references to "Customer" and "User" in this section are used interchangeably without clear
    distinction, which could cause uncertainty about which party bears indemnification obligations.</p>

<h3>Ownership of Tool_5</h3>
<p>Tool_5 and all associated intellectual property, including but not limited to software code, algorithms, databases,
    user interfaces, documentation, and trademarks, are and shall remain the exclusive property of Tool_5 or its
    licensors. Neither the Customer nor the User acquires any ownership rights in Tool_5 through the use of the Platform
    or by virtue of this Agreement. The license granted herein is limited to the use of the Platform strictly in
    accordance with these Terms and does not convey any rights to modify, reproduce, or create derivative works of
    Tool_5.</p>
<p>Customers and Users acknowledge that Tool_5 retains all rights, title, and interest in and to any improvements,
    enhancements, or modifications made to the Platform, whether such developments arise from Tool_5’s own efforts or
    from suggestions and feedback provided by Customers or Users. Notwithstanding this, the Agreement does not
    explicitly clarify the ownership status of User-generated Data or any custom configurations implemented by the
    Customer, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding the rights to such materials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably in this section, which may cause confusion
    about which party is responsible for protecting Tool_5’s proprietary rights. It is the responsibility of both
    Customers and Users to ensure that their use of the Platform does not infringe upon Tool_5’s ownership or violate
    any confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p>Any unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of Tool_5 or its components outside the scope of this Agreement
    is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action. Tool_5 reserves the right to enforce its intellectual
    property rights to the fullest extent permitted by law. Customers and Users agree to promptly notify Tool_5 of any
    suspected infringement or misuse of its proprietary materials. Failure to do so may jeopardize Tool_5’s ability to
    protect its ownership interests.</p>

<h3>License Grant</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Tool_5 hereby grants to the Customer a limited, non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Platform solely for the purpose of compliance monitoring
    and related activities within the scope of the Customer’s subscription plan. This license permits authorized Users
    designated by the Customer to utilize the Platform features in accordance with their assigned roles and
    permissions.</p>
<p>The license granted does not convey any ownership rights or title to the Platform or any intellectual property
    contained therein. Customers and Users may not sublicense, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer the rights granted
    under this license without the prior written consent of Tool_5. Additionally, the license is conditioned on the
    Customer’s compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and these Terms.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the license allows for usage by designated Users, the Agreement does not clearly
    distinguish between rights granted to the Customer as a legal entity and those extended to individual Users,
    potentially leading to ambiguity regarding the scope of permitted use. Furthermore, Tool_5 reserves the right to
    suspend or terminate the license for any User or Customer who breaches these Terms or engages in unauthorized
    activities, although the process and criteria for such suspension are not explicitly defined herein.</p>
<p>The license granted herein is limited to the use of the Platform as provided by Tool_5 and does not include any
    rights to access source code, underlying algorithms, or proprietary components beyond what is made available through
    the standard user interface. Any attempt to circumvent these restrictions, including unauthorized access or
    modification of the Platform, shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Lastly, despite the license terms, certain advanced features or functionalities may be restricted to specific
    subscription tiers or administrative roles, and Tool_5 retains sole discretion to modify the availability of such
    features without prior notice. This may result in discrepancies between the license scope as described herein and
    actual feature access, which Customers and Users should consider when evaluating their usage rights.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Use</h3>
<p>Users and Customers agree to use the Tool_5 Platform solely for lawful purposes and in compliance with these Terms.
    Any use of the Platform that violates applicable laws, regulations, or third-party rights is strictly prohibited.
    This includes, but is not limited to, unauthorized access, misuse of compliance reports, or activities intended to
    disrupt or degrade the performance of the Platform.</p>
<p>Specifically, Users and Customers shall not (i) attempt to bypass or disable any security or usage restrictions
    implemented by Tool_5; (ii) use the Platform to transmit malicious code, viruses, or other harmful components; (iii)
    engage in data scraping or automated extraction of Data beyond the limits permitted under their subscription plan;
    or (iv) share login credentials or otherwise allow access to unauthorized individuals.</p>
<p>While the terms "User" and "Customer" are generally used to denote different roles, in this section these terms may
    be applied interchangeably, which could cause uncertainty regarding which party bears responsibility for compliance
    with these restrictions. It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that all designated Users adhere to
    these limitations.</p>
<p>Tool_5 reserves the right to monitor usage patterns and suspend or terminate access for any User or Customer
    suspected of violating these restrictions. However, the criteria and procedures for such enforcement actions are not
    explicitly detailed, potentially leading to ambiguity in their application. Additionally, despite the prohibition of
    unauthorized data extraction, Tool_5 may permit certain forms of data export at its sole discretion, which may
    conflict with the blanket restrictions stated herein.</p>
<p>Any violation of these restrictions may result in immediate suspension of access, termination of the Agreement, and
    potential legal action. Tool_5 disclaims liability for any damages or losses incurred due to enforcement of these
    restrictions. Users and Customers are encouraged to seek clarification from Tool_5 if uncertainties arise regarding
    acceptable use.</p>

<h2>Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
<p>Tool_5 is committed to protecting the privacy and security of Data submitted by Users and Customers in connection
    with the use of the Platform. All Data collected through the Platform, including compliance inputs, reports, and
    usage metrics, will be handled in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. Tool_5 implements
    industry-standard technical and organizational measures designed to safeguard Data against unauthorized access,
    disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
<p>Users and Customers acknowledge and agree that Tool_5 may collect and process certain personal information necessary
    to provide and improve the Platform’s services. This may include contact details, usage logs, and device
    information. Tool_5 will use such information solely for purposes related to service delivery, analytics, and
    compliance auditing. However, the duration for which personal Data is retained is subject to Tool_5’s discretion and
    may vary; although elsewhere in this Agreement Data retention is described as indefinite, this section implies that
    Data may be deleted after a reasonable period, which is not explicitly defined.</p>
<p>Data submitted to the Platform remains the property of the Customer, but Tool_5 reserves the right to use aggregated
    and anonymized Data for research and development purposes. The terms "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably
    in this section, which may cause some uncertainty regarding which party holds specific privacy obligations,
    especially when personal Data pertains to individual Users.</p>
<p>Tool_5 does not warrant that Data transmission over the internet or storage on its servers is completely secure, and
    Users and Customers assume the risk of any potential breaches. In the event of a confirmed data breach affecting
    personal information, Tool_5 will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify affected parties within a timeframe
    deemed appropriate, but no specific notification period is guaranteed under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Customers are responsible for ensuring that all Data submitted complies with applicable privacy laws, including
    obtaining any necessary consents for processing personal Data of their Users or third parties. Tool_5 disclaims
    liability for any failure by Customers to comply with such obligations or for any consequences arising from Data
    misuse or unauthorized disclosures.</p>

<h3>Collection of User Data</h3>
<p>Tool_5 collects certain data from Users and Customers as part of the operation and enhancement of the Platform. This
    data may include, but is not limited to, personal identifiers, usage statistics, device information, and interaction
    logs. The collection of such information is necessary to provide core services, improve functionality, and ensure
    compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Users and Customers acknowledge and consent to the collection
    and processing of this data in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>Data collection occurs both actively, through direct input by Users or Customers, and passively, via automated
    monitoring of Platform interactions. While Tool_5 endeavors to limit data collection to what is strictly necessary,
    the scope and nature of collected data may evolve over time without explicit notification. Notably, the terms "User"
    and "Customer" are sometimes used interchangeably in this section, which may create uncertainty regarding who is the
    subject of specific data collection activities.</p>
<p>Tool_5 retains collected data for purposes including service improvement, analytics, auditing, and compliance
    verification. However, there is some inconsistency within this Agreement concerning retention periods: elsewhere,
    Data is described as being retained indefinitely, while in this section, data may be retained only for a "reasonable
    period," a term that is not clearly defined. This ambiguity may lead to differing interpretations regarding the
    duration of data storage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tool_5 may share aggregated or anonymized data with third parties for research or benchmarking purposes.
    However, no personal or identifiable information will be disclosed without prior consent unless required by law.
    Users and Customers are responsible for ensuring that any Data they submit complies with all applicable privacy
    regulations and that appropriate consents have been obtained from individuals whose information is included.</p>
<p>In case Users or Customers have concerns regarding the collection or use of their data, they are encouraged to
    contact Tool_5’s support team. Despite best efforts, Tool_5 does not guarantee complete security or privacy of
    collected data and disclaims liability for unauthorized access or breaches that may occur.</p>

<h3>Data Usage and Sharing</h3>
<p>Tool_5 utilizes Data submitted by Users and Customers primarily to deliver the compliance monitoring services as
    outlined in this Agreement. This includes processing inputted Data to perform automated compliance checks, generate
    reports, and provide actionable insights. In addition, Tool_5 may analyze aggregated Data to improve Platform
    functionality, enhance user experience, and develop new features. Such usage is conducted in accordance with
    applicable data protection laws and internal security policies.</p>
<p>Tool_5 may share Data with third-party service providers who assist in the operation, maintenance, or improvement of
    the Platform. These service providers are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of
    the Data and to use it solely for the purposes authorized by Tool_5. However, Tool_5 does not disclose personally
    identifiable information to third parties for marketing or unrelated purposes without explicit consent from the User
    or Customer.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while Tool_5 endeavors to protect Data confidentiality, the terms "User" and "Customer"
    are used interchangeably in this section, which may create uncertainty regarding which party’s Data may be subject
    to sharing or processing activities. Furthermore, the Agreement does not explicitly clarify whether Data originating
    from individual Users acting on behalf of a Customer is treated differently from Data submitted by Customers
    directly, potentially leading to ambiguity in data ownership and control.</p>
<p>Tool_5 reserves the right to disclose Data if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. In
    such cases, Tool_5 will, where legally permissible, notify the affected User or Customer prior to disclosure.
    Contradictorily, elsewhere in this Agreement, it is stated that Data retention policies may involve indefinite
    storage, but here, the duration and conditions under which Data is retained or deleted prior to or after sharing are
    not clearly defined, which may lead to conflicting interpretations.</p>
<p>Users and Customers remain responsible for understanding and managing their Data sharing preferences and for ensuring
    compliance with any applicable confidentiality obligations. For further inquiries or concerns regarding Data usage
    and sharing practices, Users and Customers are advised to consult Tool_5’s privacy policy or contact support
    directly.</p>

<h3>User Rights and Controls</h3>
<p>Users and Customers retain certain rights and controls over the Data they submit to and manage within the Tool_5
    Platform. These rights include the ability to access, review, correct, and delete Data in accordance with applicable
    laws and the provisions of this Agreement. Customers may designate Users to exercise such rights on their behalf;
    however, the distinction between "User" and "Customer" in this context may be unclear due to inconsistent
    terminology usage throughout this Agreement.</p>
<p>Tool_5 provides interface tools enabling Users to export Data and compliance reports for their internal use. While
    Users may request deletion of specific Data records, Tool_5 reserves the right to retain backup copies or aggregated
    data for analytical and auditing purposes indefinitely. This retention policy may conflict with Users’ expectations
    of data removal and contradicts earlier statements suggesting Data may be deleted after a reasonable period. Such
    discrepancies should be carefully considered by Customers when managing their Data.</p>
<p>Users may also control notification preferences related to compliance alerts and system updates through configurable
    settings within the Platform. However, Tool_5 retains sole discretion over the timing and content of critical
    notifications, and Users acknowledge that some alerts may be delivered without prior customization options. This
    limitation may affect the responsiveness of Customers to regulatory changes.</p>
<p>Requests to exercise rights related to Data access, correction, or deletion should be submitted in writing to
    Tool_5’s designated support channels. While Tool_5 commits to responding within a reasonable timeframe, this term
    remains undefined within this Agreement, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding the expected response period.
    Furthermore, Tool_5 may deny or delay requests if such actions interfere with compliance auditing, legal
    obligations, or legitimate business interests.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Customers are responsible for ensuring that their Users understand and appropriately manage these rights
    and controls, notwithstanding the interchangeable use of the terms "User" and "Customer" that may complicate
    internal accountability. Tool_5 disclaims liability for any misunderstandings or failures arising from such
    ambiguities.</p>

<h2>Liability and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Tool_5 and its affiliates disclaim all warranties, whether
    express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability,
    fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Tool_5 Platform and all related services are provided
    "as is" and "as available," without any guarantee of accuracy, completeness, or reliability. Tool_5 does not warrant
    that the Platform will be error-free, uninterrupted, or free from security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Users and Customers acknowledge that compliance determinations based on the Platform’s outputs are made at their own
    risk. Tool_5 expressly disclaims any liability for decisions or actions taken in reliance on the Platform’s
    automated compliance checks, reports, or recommendations. Furthermore, Tool_5 shall not be liable for any indirect,
    incidental, consequential, punitive, or special damages, including loss of profits, revenue, data, or business
    opportunities, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tool_5’s total aggregate liability arising from or related to this Agreement, whether
    in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the amount of fees paid by the Customer to Tool_5 during the
    twelve (12) months preceding the claim. This limitation applies regardless of the form of action, and even if Tool_5
    has been advised of the potential for damages.</p>
<p>It is noted that the terms "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably in this section, which may create ambiguity
    regarding which party bears responsibility for indemnification or claims. Moreover, while this Agreement limits
    Tool_5’s liability, it does not explicitly address the liability of Users or Customers for misuse of the Platform or
    for violations of applicable laws, leaving such responsibilities somewhat undefined. Users and Customers are
    encouraged to consult their own legal counsel to understand their respective obligations and risks.</p>
<p>Any failure by Tool_5 to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of its rights. Should
    any provision of this section be found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
    effect.</p>

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, neither Tool_5 nor its affiliates, licensors, or service providers
    shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited
    to loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities, arising out of or related to the use or inability to
    use the Platform, even if Tool_5 has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation applies
    regardless of whether the claim is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or other legal theory.</p>
<p>Tool_5’s total aggregate liability to the Customer or User for any and all claims arising under or related to this
    Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Customer to Tool_5 in the six (6) months immediately preceding
    the event giving rise to the claim. Notably, this six-month limitation period contradicts the twelve (12) month
    limitation period referenced elsewhere in this Agreement, potentially causing confusion as to the applicable
    cap.</p>
<p>Neither Tool_5 nor its affiliates shall be liable for any damages resulting from unauthorized access to or alteration
    of Data, loss or corruption of Data, or any failure to comply with applicable laws by the Customer or User.
    Furthermore, the terms "Customer" and "User" may be used interchangeably in this section without clear distinction,
    which may blur the allocation of liability between individual Users and organizational Customers.</p>
<p>In no event shall Tool_5 be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable
    control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, terrorism, labor disputes, or governmental
    actions. This limitation shall apply even if such causes render performance commercially impracticable. Any
    ambiguities regarding the scope of this limitation shall be resolved in favor of Tool_5.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
<p>TOOL_5 PROVIDES THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
    WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. TOOL_5 EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    TOOL_5 MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE PLATFORM WILL MEET THE CUSTOMER’S OR USER’S REQUIREMENTS, BE
    UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
<p>WHILE TOOL_5 ENDEAVORS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE COMPLIANCE CHECKS, REPORTS, AND INSIGHTS, IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE
    COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY OF SUCH OUTPUTS. THE PLATFORM’S RESULTS ARE INTENDED SOLELY FOR GENERAL
    INFORMATION PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. CUSTOMERS AND
    USERS ACCEPT SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL DECISIONS MADE BASED ON THE PLATFORM’S DATA.</p>
<p>TOOL_5 DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT DATA SUBMITTED BY USERS OR CUSTOMERS WILL BE RETAINED OR DELETED IN ACCORDANCE
    WITH EXPECTED TIMEFRAMES, GIVEN THE CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT REGARDING DATA RETENTION
    POLICIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE TERMS "USER" AND "CUSTOMER" ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION, WHICH MAY
    LEAD TO AMBIGUITY AS TO WHICH PARTY IS ENTITLED TO THESE DISCLAIMERS OR BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR WARRANTY
    CLAIMS.</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, TOOL_5 MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE PLATFORM WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH
    ALL THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. USERS AND CUSTOMERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
    THEY ASSUME ALL RISKS ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES.</p>

<h3>Indemnification</h3>
<p>Users and Customers agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Tool_5, its affiliates, licensors, and service
    providers, along with their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all
    claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs,
    arising out of or related to: (i) any violation of this Agreement by the User or Customer; (ii) any misuse of the
    Tool_5 Platform; (iii) negligent or willful acts or omissions by the User or Customer; or (iv) any claim that the
    Data submitted infringes upon the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other rights of third
    parties.</p>
<p>Each indemnifying party’s obligations under this section are conditioned upon Tool_5 providing prompt written notice
    of any such claim, reasonable cooperation in the defense or settlement, and sole control over the defense and
    settlement of the claim. Tool_5 reserves the right to participate in the defense of any claim at its own expense.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party from its
    obligations except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices Tool_5’s ability to defend the claim.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the terms "User" and "Customer" are sometimes used interchangeably within this Agreement, and
    in this section, it may be unclear which party bears primary indemnification responsibility in certain
    circumstances, particularly when multiple Users act on behalf of a single Customer. Tool_5 encourages Customers to
    establish clear internal policies to address indemnification obligations among their Users to avoid potential
    disputes.</p>
<p>Additionally, while this section requires indemnification for infringement claims related to Data, the Agreement does
    not explicitly address indemnity for claims arising from Tool_5’s own negligence or breaches, which may create
    ambiguity concerning the scope of indemnification coverage. Users and Customers should seek independent legal advice
    to clarify these responsibilities as applicable.</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>Either Tool_5 or the Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to the other party.
    Termination may be effected for convenience or for cause, including but not limited to a material breach of these
    Terms by the User or Customer that remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of written
    notice specifying the breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tool_5 reserves the right to suspend or terminate
    access immediately without prior notice in cases of unauthorized use, suspected fraud, or activities that threaten
    the security or integrity of the Platform.</p>
<p>Upon termination, all licenses granted hereunder shall immediately cease, and the User and Customer shall discontinue
    all use of the Platform. Tool_5 may, but is not obligated to, delete or anonymize Data associated with the
    terminated account within a reasonable period. However, conflicting statements elsewhere in this Agreement regarding
    Data retention mean that in some cases Data may be retained indefinitely for auditing or compliance purposes,
    leading to potential uncertainty about post-termination Data management.</p>
<p>Termination shall not relieve either party of obligations incurred prior to the termination date, including payment
    of any fees due. Notably, the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used inconsistently in this section; for example,
    termination rights may apply to either party, but it is not always clear whether actions must be taken by the
    individual User or the Customer entity, potentially causing ambiguity in enforcement.</p>
<p>Any provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination, including but not limited to
    confidentiality, indemnification, intellectual property rights, and limitations of liability, shall remain in full
    force and effect notwithstanding termination. Tool_5 shall have no liability for any damages or losses arising from
    termination or suspension of access, whether initiated by Tool_5 or the Customer.</p>

<h3>Termination by User</h3>
<p>Users may elect to terminate their access to the Tool_5 Platform at any time by providing written notice to Tool_5.
    Such termination shall be effective upon receipt of the notice or at a later date specified by the User in the
    notice, subject to any applicable subscription or payment obligations. It is the responsibility of the User to
    ensure that all outstanding fees or charges related to their account are settled prior to termination, as Tool_5 may
    not process termination requests for accounts with unpaid balances.</p>
<p>Upon termination by a User, access to the Platform will be revoked, and the User must cease all use of the services
    immediately. However, termination by a User does not automatically terminate the subscription or account held by the
    Customer, if the User is acting on behalf of an organizational Customer. The distinction between "User" and
    "Customer" in this context may lead to ambiguity, as a User’s termination may not affect the broader Customer’s
    ongoing access or obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Tool_5 reserves the right to retain Data associated with the terminating User in accordance with its data retention
    policies. While elsewhere in this Agreement it is stated that Data may be deleted after a reasonable period, the
    specifics of such periods are not clearly defined, and in some instances, Data may be retained indefinitely for
    auditing and compliance purposes. Users should be aware that deletion of their personal Data or account information
    may not be immediate or guaranteed following termination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the User is the sole authorized individual associated with a Customer account, termination of their
    access may result in suspension or termination of the Customer’s overall subscription at Tool_5’s discretion. Tool_5
    will attempt to notify the Customer in such cases, but no explicit obligation to do so is set forth herein, which
    could lead to uncertainty regarding continuity of service. Users and Customers are encouraged to coordinate
    termination requests to avoid unintended service disruptions.</p>

<h3>Termination by Tool_5</h3>
<p>Tool_5 reserves the right to terminate this Agreement and suspend or terminate access to the Platform immediately
    upon written or electronic notice to the User or Customer, without liability, for any reason including but not
    limited to: (i) violation of any provision of these Terms; (ii) unauthorized or fraudulent use of the Platform;
    (iii) failure to pay fees when due; (iv) breach of security or suspected compromise of account credentials; or (v)
    conduct which, in Tool_5’s sole discretion, may harm the integrity, security, or reputation of the Platform or its
    services.</p>
<p>Such termination by Tool_5 may be effected without prior warning or opportunity to cure, except where required by
    applicable law. However, in situations where a cure period is granted, the standard timeframe shall be thirty (30)
    days from the date of notice, unless otherwise specified. It should be noted that the terms "User" and "Customer"
    may be applied inconsistently in this section, creating uncertainty as to which party is the recipient of
    termination notices or subject to termination actions.</p>
<p>Upon termination, Tool_5 may, but is not obligated to, delete or anonymize Data associated with the terminated
    account in accordance with its data retention policies. This may conflict with other provisions in this Agreement
    stating that Data may be retained indefinitely for auditing or service improvement purposes, leading to ambiguity
    regarding post-termination Data handling.</p>
<p>Termination by Tool_5 does not relieve the Customer or User of any payment obligations accrued prior to termination.
    Furthermore, Tool_5 disclaims any liability for damages or losses resulting from termination or suspension,
    including any loss of Data or interruption of service. Users and Customers acknowledge that Tool_5’s discretion in
    termination matters is broad and final, though the specific criteria and procedures for making termination decisions
    are not explicitly detailed herein, which may result in interpretive inconsistencies.</p>

<h3>Effect of Termination</h3>
<p>Upon termination of this Agreement, whether initiated by the User, Customer, or Tool_5, all rights and licenses
    granted to the Customer and Users under this Agreement shall immediately cease, and access to the Tool_5 Platform
    will be revoked without further notice. Users and Customers must promptly discontinue all use of the Platform and
    any related services. Notwithstanding termination, any obligations or liabilities accrued prior to the termination
    date shall survive and remain enforceable according to the terms herein.</p>
<p>Tool_5 may, at its sole discretion, delete, anonymize, or retain Data associated with the terminated User or Customer
    account. While certain provisions of this Agreement suggest that Data may be deleted within a reasonable period
    following termination, other sections indicate that Data may be retained indefinitely for purposes such as auditing,
    compliance, or service improvement. This conflicting language may lead to uncertainty regarding the actual duration
    of Data retention post-termination. Customers and Users are advised to consult Tool_5 directly for clarification on
    Data handling in their specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Termination does not absolve the Customer or User from any outstanding payment obligations, and Tool_5 reserves the
    right to pursue collection of any unpaid fees or charges incurred prior to termination. Furthermore, any licenses or
    access rights granted to individual Users may be terminated independently of the Customer’s account status, which
    could result in scenarios where a Customer remains active while certain Users have no access. This inconsistent use
    of the terms "User" and "Customer" throughout this Agreement may cause ambiguity regarding the scope and effect of
    termination actions.</p>
<p>Additionally, all confidentiality, indemnification, intellectual property, and limitation of liability provisions
    shall survive termination. Tool_5 disclaims any liability for damages or losses arising from termination or
    suspension of access, including any Data loss or service interruption. Users and Customers acknowledge and accept
    these terms as part of their continued use and engagement with the Platform.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its
    breach, termination, or validity, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the matter amicably through good faith
    negotiations within a reasonable period. Should such negotiations fail to produce a resolution, either Tool_5 or the
    Customer may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
    or another mutually agreed arbitration body. The seat of arbitration shall be in a location mutually agreed upon by
    the parties; however, if no agreement is reached, the default venue shall be the principal place of business of
    Tool_5.</p>
<p>The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English and the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on
    both parties, subject only to limited judicial review as permitted under applicable law. Each party shall bear its
    own costs and attorney’s fees unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either
    party retains the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
    unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information or intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>It is expressly acknowledged that the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used inconsistently in this section and
    elsewhere, which could cause ambiguity in determining which party is entitled to initiate dispute resolution or bear
    related responsibilities. For the avoidance of doubt, unless expressly stated otherwise, all references to
    "Customer" herein shall be interpreted to include its designated Users acting within the scope of this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>Additionally, any delays in initiating arbitration or pursuing legal remedies shall not constitute a waiver of rights
    under this Agreement. The parties agree to comply with any interim measures ordered by the arbitrator or court
    pending final resolution. However, the Agreement does not explicitly define the maximum duration of the negotiation
    period prior to arbitration, potentially leading to differing interpretations of when formal dispute resolution
    procedures may commence.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
    regard to its conflict of law principles. Both Tool_5 and the Customer agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the state and federal courts located within Delaware for any disputes arising out of or related to this
    Agreement, except as otherwise provided in the Dispute Resolution section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the use of
    the terms "User" and "Customer" throughout this Agreement may cause uncertainty in determining which party is
    subject to the governing law or jurisdiction in certain contexts, particularly when individual Users operate
    independently of the Customer entity.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between applicable laws and the provisions of this Agreement, the latter shall prevail
    to the extent permitted by law, unless otherwise explicitly stated. However, the Agreement does not specify whether
    international Users or Customers located outside the United States are subject to the same governing law or if
    alternative jurisdictions may apply, creating potential ambiguity for cross-border use.</p>
<p>Customers and Users acknowledge that compliance with local laws and regulations remains their sole responsibility,
    and that Tool_5’s choice of governing law does not exempt Users from adhering to applicable legal requirements in
    their respective jurisdictions. Furthermore, this section does not explicitly clarify the treatment of choice of law
    in the event of a merger, acquisition, or change in Tool_5’s corporate structure, potentially leading to
    interpretive inconsistencies.</p>
<p>By using the Tool_5 Platform, Users and Customers consent to the application of Delaware law and waive any objections
    to venue or jurisdiction in such courts, except where mandatory legal provisions dictate otherwise. Any ambiguity
    regarding governing law or jurisdiction arising from the inconsistent use of "User" and "Customer" terms should be
    resolved in favor of Tool_5’s interpretations.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
<p>By agreeing to these Terms, the User and Customer mutually consent that any disputes, claims, or controversies
    arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its formation, breach, termination, or validity, shall be
    resolved exclusively through binding arbitration, except where otherwise provided herein. Arbitration shall be
    conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or an alternative arbitration
    service mutually agreed upon by Tool_5 and the Customer. Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration will be held in
    the principal place of business of Tool_5, and proceedings shall be conducted in English.</p>
<p>The parties acknowledge that arbitration is intended to provide a more efficient and cost-effective resolution
    process compared to judicial litigation. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding and may be entered as
    a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys’ fees unless
    the arbitrator determines otherwise. Notwithstanding this arbitration requirement, either Tool_5 or the Customer
    retains the right to seek temporary injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent unauthorized
    use or disclosure of confidential information or intellectual property.</p>
<p>It is noted that references to “User” and “Customer” within this section may be used interchangeably without clear
    distinction, which could create ambiguity as to which party is entitled to initiate arbitration or bear related
    obligations. Furthermore, the Agreement does not explicitly define whether individual Users acting independently
    from the Customer entity are bound by this arbitration provision, potentially leading to conflicting interpretations
    regarding applicability.</p>
<p>In addition, the timeframe within which the parties must attempt good faith negotiations prior to initiating
    arbitration is described elsewhere as a “reasonable period,” but no specific duration is stated here, potentially
    resulting in uncertainty regarding when arbitration proceedings may commence. Users and Customers are encouraged to
    seek clarification from Tool_5 to avoid disputes over procedural timing.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The parties agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including
    disputes concerning its validity, interpretation, or enforcement, shall be brought exclusively in the state or
    federal courts located within the State of Delaware, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Tool_5 and the Customer.
    Both Tool_5 and the Customer hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waive any
    objections based on forum non conveniens or other venue-related defenses.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicability of this exclusive jurisdiction clause to individual Users may vary
    depending on their legal relationship with the Customer. Since the terms "User" and "Customer" are used
    interchangeably throughout this Agreement without consistent clarification, it may be unclear whether individual
    Users operating independently are bound by this jurisdiction provision. Customers and Users should seek independent
    legal advice to understand the implications for their specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this Agreement does not explicitly address jurisdictional matters for Users or Customers located outside
    the United States. In such cases, local laws and regulations may impose additional jurisdictional requirements or
    restrictions, which the parties acknowledge and agree to comply with in good faith. Tool_5 does not waive any rights
    to assert jurisdiction or venue in alternative forums where permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between the jurisdiction provisions herein and other sections of this Agreement, the
    jurisdiction clause shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise. However, the inconsistent use of the terms
    "User" and "Customer" throughout this Agreement may give rise to ambiguity about which party is subject to exclusive
    jurisdiction, potentially complicating enforcement efforts.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between Tool_5 and the Customer with respect to the subject
    matter herein and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and
    representations, except as expressly provided herein. Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must be made
    in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties to be effective. However, certain provisions may
    be unilaterally updated by Tool_5 as outlined elsewhere in this Agreement, which may cause some inconsistency
    regarding the formal amendment process.</p>
<p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement due to
    causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes,
    governmental actions, or interruptions in telecommunications or internet services. Such force majeure events shall
    excuse performance for the duration of the impact, though the term “reasonable time” for resumption is not
    explicitly defined, potentially leading to differing interpretations.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the invalid provision shall be
    replaced by a valid provision that most closely reflects the original intent. The failure of either party to enforce
    any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>This Agreement is not intended to create any partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between
    Tool_5 and the Customer or Users. Neither party has the authority to bind or obligate the other except as expressly
    set forth herein. Notably, the interchangeable use of “User” and “Customer” throughout this Agreement may cause
    ambiguity in determining which party holds specific obligations or rights under this clause.</p>
<p>All notices and communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed given when
    delivered personally, sent by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), or by email with confirmation
    of transmission, to the respective contact information provided by the Customer or Tool_5. The parties agree to keep
    such contact information current but acknowledge that failure to do so may result in missed communications without
    liability to the other party.</p>

<h3>Amendments to Terms</h3>
<p>Tool_5 reserves the right to amend, modify, or update these Terms at any time in its sole discretion. Such amendments
    may be necessary to reflect changes in legal requirements, business practices, technological developments, or other
    factors impacting the provision of the Platform and related services. Tool_5 will endeavor to notify Customers and
    Users of material changes by posting updated Terms on the Platform or through direct communications such as
    email.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tool_5 is not obligated to provide prior notice before implementing amendments, and
    any such notices are intended to be informative rather than a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the
    changes. Continued use of the Platform by either a User or Customer following the posting or communication of
    amended Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes. If a User or Customer does not agree to the amended Terms,
    they must cease use of the Platform immediately and terminate their account in accordance with the Termination
    provisions herein.</p>
<p>The terms "User" and "Customer" may be used inconsistently in this section and elsewhere, which could lead to
    ambiguity regarding which party is required to accept amendments or is bound by updated provisions. For example,
    some notifications may be directed only to the Customer entity, while individual Users may remain unaware of changes
    affecting their access or usage rights. Customers are therefore responsible for communicating relevant updates to
    their Users to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between prior versions of these Terms and the amended Terms, the latter shall prevail as
    of the effective date of the amendment. However, the effective date of amendments may vary depending on the method
    and timing of notification, and such variability may create uncertainty regarding the applicable Terms during
    transitional periods. Users and Customers should review the Terms regularly to remain informed of their rights and
    obligations under the current version.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement, including these Terms of Service and any referenced documents, constitutes the entire understanding
    and agreement between Tool_5 and the Customer with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior or
    contemporaneous communications, representations, negotiations, and agreements, whether oral or written, relating to
    the use of the Tool_5 Platform and services.</p>
<p>Any prior agreements, understandings, or representations not expressly incorporated into this Agreement shall have no
    force or effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, references made elsewhere in this Agreement to certain provisions
    that may supersede prior agreements or communications may create ambiguity about which terms ultimately govern in
    specific circumstances. Users and Customers should carefully review all relevant documents to clarify any such
    inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Modifications or amendments to this Agreement must generally be made in writing and signed by authorized
    representatives of Tool_5 and the Customer to be effective. However, as outlined in the Amendments to Terms section,
    Tool_5 reserves the right to unilaterally update or modify these Terms without prior consent from either the User or
    Customer. This apparent contradiction between formal amendment requirements and unilateral changes may lead to
    confusion regarding the enforceability of such updates.</p>
<p>The terms "User" and "Customer" are sometimes used interchangeably in this Agreement, including within this section,
    which may cause uncertainty as to which party is bound by specific obligations or entitled to rights herein. Unless
    otherwise specified, references to "Customer" shall be interpreted to include its authorized Users acting within the
    scope of this Agreement, though this interpretation is not uniformly applied, potentially resulting in differing
    understandings of responsibilities.</p>
<p>By using the Platform or continuing services, Users and Customers acknowledge that they have read, understood, and
    agreed to be bound by the entire Agreement, including all incorporated terms and conditions. Any conflict between
    this Agreement and other documents or policies shall be resolved in favor of this Agreement unless explicitly stated
    otherwise in writing by Tool_5.</p>

<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>If any provision or part of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of the Agreement, which shall continue in full
    force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision
    with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the original intent and economic effect of the
    severed provision.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
    enforceability of other provisions, unless the severed provision is deemed by Tool_5 to be material to the overall
    Agreement, in which case Tool_5 may elect to terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the User or Customer. It
    is important to note that the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used inconsistently in this context, which could
    create ambiguity regarding the party to whom termination notices must be sent should severability trigger such
    action.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a court modifies a provision to render it enforceable, such modified provision shall be deemed
    substituted for the original, and the Agreement shall be enforced accordingly. However, in instances where the
    parties cannot agree on a suitable substitute provision, the original provision shall be deemed severed without
    affecting the enforceability of the remaining Agreement.</p>
<p>In the event that multiple provisions are found invalid or unenforceable, the foregoing severability principles shall
    apply cumulatively. Users and Customers acknowledge that this section may create some uncertainty due to the
    interchangeable use of terminology and the discretionary authority granted to Tool_5, and they agree to seek
    clarification where necessary to understand their rights and obligations fully.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure</h3>
<p>Neither Tool_5 nor the User or Customer shall be held liable for any failure or delay in performing their obligations
    under this Agreement if such failure or delay results from causes beyond their reasonable control, including but not
    limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, governmental actions, pandemics, or
    interruptions in telecommunications or internet services.</p>
<p>In the event of a force majeure event, the affected party shall promptly notify the other party in writing, detailing
    the nature of the event and the expected duration of the disruption. However, the term “promptly” is not
    specifically defined within this Agreement, which may result in ambiguity regarding the timing and sufficiency of
    such notifications. The parties agree to use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of force majeure events and
    to resume performance as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>During any period of force majeure, the obligations of the affected party shall be suspended to the extent directly
    impacted by the event. If the force majeure event continues for an extended period, typically considered to be
    thirty (30) days or more, either party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice without liability. Notably,
    the distinction between "User" and "Customer" is inconsistently applied in this section, potentially creating
    uncertainty as to which party may exercise termination rights under force majeure conditions.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that Tool_5’s obligation to maintain service availability, as described elsewhere in this
    Agreement, is subject to suspension during force majeure events. Nevertheless, conflicting language in the Service
    Availability section regarding notification and data integrity during service interruptions may lead to confusion
    concerning Tool_5’s responsibilities in such circumstances. Users and Customers are encouraged to communicate
    proactively to manage expectations and minimize disruptions.</p>
