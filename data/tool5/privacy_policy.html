<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy of Tool_5, a compliance monitoring software designed specifically for product managers.
    This document outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal information of our Users and
    Customers when they access or use Tool_5 services. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is safeguarded in
    accordance with applicable data protection laws and industry standards.</p>
<p>Throughout this policy, the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used interchangeably to refer to individuals or
    organizations utilizing Tool_5. However, it should be noted that certain provisions may apply differently depending
    on the user type, and where such distinctions exist, they will be clarified. Our objective is to provide
    transparency regarding our data handling practices while enabling product managers to leverage our software
    effectively.</p>
<p>Tool_5 collects various types of information, including personal identifiers and usage data, to facilitate automated
    compliance checks and generate actionable insights. We retain this information for a reasonable period necessary to
    fulfill the purposes described herein, though the exact duration may vary based on regulatory requirements or
    internal policies. Users should be aware that some data may be retained longer than expected due to backup and
    archival processes.</p>
<p>By accessing or using Tool_5, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices,
    please refrain from using the software. We reserve the right to update this policy at any time, and any changes will
    be communicated through the Tool_5 platform or via email notifications.</p>

<h3>Purpose of This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform Users and Customers about how Tool_5 collects, processes,
    stores, and protects personal and usage data in connection with the provision of our compliance monitoring services.
    This policy establishes the principles and practices that govern our data handling activities to ensure transparency
    and accountability in line with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Tool_5 is committed to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of all data collected through the platform. This
    includes data obtained during automated compliance checks, reporting functions, and other analytics features. Our
    objective is to clarify the scope of data usage, including the circumstances under which data may be shared with
    third parties, such as regulatory authorities or service providers, as well as the rights and obligations of Users
    and Customers regarding their data.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while this policy aims to cover all relevant aspects of data privacy, certain terms such as
    “reasonable period” or “appropriate safeguards” are not explicitly defined within this document and may be subject
    to interpretation based on context or evolving regulatory standards. Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer”
    are sometimes used interchangeably, which may lead to ambiguity in specific provisions regarding data subject rights
    and responsibilities.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy also serves to outline the procedures for data access, correction, and deletion requests,
    although Users should be aware that deletion of certain data may not be immediate due to backup retention policies
    or other internal requirements. By using Tool_5, you acknowledge and consent to the practices described herein,
    including those related to data retention that may appear conflicting in different sections of this document.</p>

<h3>Scope of Application</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies exclusively to the collection, processing, and storage of personal information by Tool_5
    in relation to its compliance monitoring services provided to product managers and affiliated organizations. It
    governs all data interactions occurring through the use of the Tool_5 platform, including web-based interfaces,
    APIs, and related software components. The policy covers both Users and Customers, though it should be noted that
    certain obligations and rights may differ between these groups depending on the nature of their engagement with
    Tool_5.</p>
<p>Tool_5 is designed to support regulatory compliance activities and internal governance processes; therefore, the
    scope of data collection is limited to information reasonably necessary to fulfill these purposes. However, the
    exact boundaries of data applicability may vary due to differing legal frameworks across jurisdictions and the
    specifics of individual contractual arrangements with Customers. As such, some data elements collected for
    compliance monitoring may also be used for internal audit and improvement functions within Tool_5, unless explicitly
    excluded by Customer agreements.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that any personal data submitted to Tool_5 complies with
    applicable laws and that affected individuals have been appropriately informed. Furthermore, while this Privacy
    Policy sets forth the general principles governing data use, it does not extend to third-party services integrated
    with the platform, whose own privacy terms will apply separately.</p>
<p>Finally, although this policy refers interchangeably to "Users" and "Customers," it should be understood that these
    terms may not always be synonymous, and certain provisions might apply differently. For example, data deletion
    requests submitted by a User may be subject to additional verification procedures if the User is not the primary
    Customer account holder. This distinction is intended to ensure data security but may cause some uncertainty
    regarding the exact rights available to individual Users versus Customers.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below. These
    definitions are intended to provide clarity and reduce ambiguity, although some terms may be interpreted differently
    depending on the context of their use within the Tool_5 platform and related documentation.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User:</strong> Any individual who accesses or utilizes Tool_5 services, including but not limited to
        product managers, compliance officers, and other personnel authorized by a Customer organization. Note that
        Users may or may not be the primary account holders, and their rights under this policy may be subject to
        verification procedures.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Customer:</strong> The legal entity or organization that has entered into an agreement with Tool_5 for
        the provision of compliance monitoring services. Customers are responsible for managing their Users and ensuring
        compliance with applicable data protection laws. In certain instances, the term “Customer” may also refer to the
        primary account holder within an organization.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person that is
        collected, processed, or stored by Tool_5. This includes, but is not limited to, names, contact details, login
        credentials, and usage data generated through interactions with the software platform.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Any operation or set of operations performed on Personal Data, including
        collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
        transmission, erasure, or destruction.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reasonable Period:</strong> A timeframe deemed appropriate by Tool_5 for retaining data to fulfill the
        purposes described in this policy. This period is not explicitly defined herein and may vary depending on
        regulatory requirements, internal policies, or backup retention schedules.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> The removal or anonymization of Personal Data from active systems. However, due
        to backup and archival processes, deleted data may persist beyond the stated retention period, potentially
        conflicting with User expectations regarding data erasure.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that while the terms “User” and “Customer” are sometimes used interchangeably in this document,
    they are not strictly synonymous and should be interpreted contextually to avoid confusion. Additionally, the
    definition of “Reasonable Period” remains intentionally vague to accommodate diverse regulatory frameworks, which
    may lead to differing interpretations among Users and Customers.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Tool_5 collects a range of information from both Users and Customers to enable the effective operation of our
    compliance monitoring services. The categories of information gathered include Personal Data provided directly by
    the Customer or User during account registration and ongoing usage, as well as data automatically collected through
    interactions with the platform.</p>
<p>Personal Data may include, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, job titles, company affiliations, and
    contact information. Additionally, Tool_5 collects usage data such as login times, compliance check results, report
    generation metrics, and system interaction logs. This data supports the automation of compliance verification and
    the generation of actionable insights tailored to product management activities.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, Tool_5 may also collect technical information related to the devices used to access the
    platform, including IP addresses, browser type, and operating system details, to enhance security and troubleshoot
    issues. However, the precise scope of technical data collection may differ depending on the Customer’s configuration
    settings and consent.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while Tool_5 endeavors to limit data collection to what is strictly necessary, some data
    elements may be retained or processed for broader purposes such as internal audits or service improvements, unless
    expressly restricted by the Customer’s contractual agreement. This may lead to overlap in data usage that is not
    fully delineated in this policy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terminology used to describe data subjects alternates between "User" and "Customer" throughout this
    document, which may cause some ambiguity regarding who is responsible for providing certain types of information or
    consenting to its collection. We recommend that Customers clarify these distinctions internally to ensure compliance
    with applicable data protection obligations.</p>

<h3>Personal Data You Provide</h3>
<p>When using Tool_5, both Customers and Users may be required to submit certain Personal Data to facilitate account
    setup, access to features, and the execution of compliance monitoring functions. This data typically includes, but
    is not limited to, names, email addresses, phone numbers, job titles, and organizational affiliations. Customers are
    responsible for ensuring that any Personal Data submitted on behalf of their Users is accurate, complete, and
    collected in compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while Customers primarily provide Personal Data during contractual onboarding and
    account administration, individual Users may also input or update their own information through the platform
    interface. However, the distinction between data submitted by Customers and that provided by Users is not always
    clearly delineated within Tool_5, which may lead to ambiguity regarding data ownership and consent obligations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Tool_5 may require submission of identification documents or other verification materials in certain
    cases to validate User credentials or Customer account status. Such documents will be handled in accordance with
    this Privacy Policy, though the retention period for these materials may vary and is not explicitly defined,
    creating some uncertainty about their lifecycle within our systems.</p>
<p>While Tool_5 endeavors to safeguard all Personal Data provided, Users and Customers should be aware that certain data
    elements may be stored beyond active use due to backup and archival processes, potentially conflicting with
    expectations of immediate deletion upon request. Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer” are sometimes used
    interchangeably in this context, which may cause confusion about which party is responsible for data accuracy and
    consent management.</p>

<h3>Data Collected Automatically</h3>
<p>In addition to Personal Data provided directly by Customers and Users, Tool_5 automatically collects certain data
    during the use of its platform to enhance functionality, monitor system performance, and support compliance
    verification processes. This automatically collected information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses,
    device identifiers, browser type and version, operating system, access times, and interaction logs within the
    software environment.</p>
<p>Such data is typically gathered through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies integrated into the
    Tool_5 platform. These mechanisms enable the software to maintain session integrity, personalize user experience,
    and detect potential security threats. However, the exact scope and nature of automatic data collection may vary
    depending on the configuration settings established by the Customer, which may result in differing levels of data
    granularity across user accounts.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although Tool_5 strives to minimize the retention of automatically collected data beyond what
    is necessary for operational and compliance purposes, some information may persist in backup systems or archives for
    extended periods. This retention practice may appear inconsistent with certain provisions related to data deletion
    elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, creating a potential conflict in understanding how long such data is kept.</p>
<p>Moreover, the terminology used throughout this document alternates between "User" and "Customer" when referring to
    data subjects involved in automatic data collection, without always specifying which party is responsible for
    monitoring or managing such data. This may cause ambiguity concerning accountability, particularly in scenarios
    where multiple Users operate under a single Customer account.</p>
<p>By continuing to use Tool_5, both Users and Customers consent to the collection and use of this automatically
    gathered information in accordance with the terms described herein, including its potential retention beyond active
    use due to backup and archival policies.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Data Sources</h3>
<p>Tool_5 may receive data from third-party sources to augment the information collected directly from Users and
    Customers. These third-party data sources can include regulatory databases, industry compliance registries, and
    authorized service providers who supply supplemental information relevant to compliance monitoring activities. The
    integration of such data enables Tool_5 to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of its automated compliance
    checks and reporting functions.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the scope and nature of third-party data obtained may vary depending on the Customer’s
    configuration and consent parameters. While Tool_5 endeavors to ensure that all third-party data is sourced in
    compliance with applicable data protection laws, the responsibility for verifying the legitimacy and appropriateness
    of such data ultimately rests with the Customer. Additionally, the Policy does not explicitly define the retention
    periods for third-party data, which may lead to inconsistencies when considered alongside the stated data deletion
    provisions applicable to User-provided information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, third-party data may be subject to different privacy and security standards than those upheld by Tool_5,
    potentially creating ambiguity regarding the overall level of protection afforded to combined data sets. The terms
    “User” and “Customer” are also used interchangeably in discussions of third-party data, which may obscure the
    precise roles and responsibilities of each party in managing and responding to data-related concerns arising from
    these external sources.</p>
<p>By using Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and consent to the incorporation of third-party data into the
    platform’s compliance monitoring processes. However, it should be recognized that certain third-party data may not
    be immediately deletable upon request due to contractual or technical constraints, which could contradict the
    general data deletion rights described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>Tool_5 utilizes the personal and usage data collected from Users and Customers to deliver and enhance our compliance
    monitoring services. Primarily, this information is employed to perform automated compliance checks, generate
    detailed reports, and provide actionable insights that assist product managers in identifying and mitigating
    regulatory risks. Additionally, the data supports internal functions such as system maintenance, performance
    optimization, and service improvement initiatives.</p>
<p>We may also use personal information to communicate with Customers and Users regarding account management, service
    updates, and important regulatory changes relevant to their product development activities. In some cases, data may
    be shared with authorized third-party service providers who support Tool_5’s operational infrastructure or assist
    with compliance-related tasks. Such disclosures are governed by confidentiality agreements and applicable data
    protection laws.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while Tool_5 intends to limit usage of personal data strictly to the purposes described
    herein, there may be instances where data is processed for broader organizational needs, such as internal audits or
    quality assurance. The exact scope of such usage is not exhaustively defined in this Privacy Policy, which may
    result in some ambiguity regarding permissible data applications beyond core compliance functions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer” are occasionally used interchangeably in this section, potentially
    leading to confusion about which party holds responsibility for consenting to specific uses of data. For clarity, it
    is recommended that Customers establish internal protocols to manage consent and data governance effectively across
    their User base.</p>
<p>Finally, while we strive to delete or anonymize data when it is no longer necessary, certain information may persist
    in backup archives or logs for extended periods, which could conflict with expectations of immediate data removal
    following User or Customer requests.</p>

<h3>Purpose of Data Processing</h3>
<p>Tool_5 processes personal and usage data collected from both Users and Customers to fulfill several essential
    objectives aligned with its core compliance monitoring services. The primary purpose of data processing is to enable
    automated regulatory checks, generate comprehensive compliance reports, and deliver actionable insights that support
    product managers in maintaining adherence to relevant industry standards and legal requirements.</p>
<p>Beyond these core functions, data processing facilitates system administration tasks, including user authentication,
    access control, and security monitoring, to safeguard the integrity of the Tool_5 platform. Additionally, data may
    be used for internal analytics aimed at improving software performance and enhancing the overall user experience.
    However, the parameters defining when and how data is repurposed for these broader organizational activities are not
    explicitly detailed, which may result in ambiguity regarding permissible secondary uses of personal information.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that while Customers generally authorize data processing through contractual agreements,
    individual Users may have varying levels of consent depending on their relationship with the Customer. This
    distinction is not consistently maintained throughout this document, occasionally leading to unclear delineations of
    responsibility for data consent and processing oversight.</p>
<p>Furthermore, notwithstanding provisions that personal data will be deleted upon request or when no longer necessary,
    certain data elements may be retained for extended periods due to backup and archival protocols. This retention
    practice may conflict with User or Customer expectations of immediate erasure, creating a potential contradiction
    within the stated data lifecycle management policies.</p>
<p>By using Tool_5, Users and Customers acknowledge and consent to the processing of their data for the purposes
    outlined above, understanding that some flexibility in data use and retention may be inherent to the platform’s
    operational requirements.</p>

<h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
<p>Tool_5 processes personal data based on various legal grounds that justify the collection and use of such information
    in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR) and similar frameworks. The primary legal bases for processing data include the necessity to
    fulfill contractual obligations with Customers, compliance with legal or regulatory requirements, and the legitimate
    interests pursued by Tool_5 to provide and improve its compliance monitoring services.</p>
<p>Specifically, data processing is carried out to perform the services agreed upon in contracts with Customers, such as
    conducting automated compliance checks and generating reports essential for regulatory adherence. In addition,
    Tool_5 may process personal information to respond to lawful requests from regulatory authorities or to meet other
    statutory duties. Legitimate interests encompass activities related to system security, fraud prevention, service
    optimization, and internal audits, provided that such processing does not override the fundamental rights and
    freedoms of the Data Subjects, whether Users or Customers.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while Customers typically provide consent or authorize processing through contractual
    arrangements, the role of individual Users in consenting to their personal data processing is not consistently
    defined throughout this Privacy Policy. This inconsistency may give rise to ambiguity regarding the extent to which
    Users independently authorize data handling or rely solely on Customer consent. Furthermore, in some cases,
    processing may occur without explicit consent when permitted by law, which may not be explicitly communicated to all
    Users.</p>
<p>Tool_5 endeavors to ensure that all processing activities adhere to the relevant legal requirements. However, due to
    the varying nature of data subjects and the multiple contexts in which processing occurs, there may be instances
    where the legal basis for certain data uses is not entirely clear or uniformly applied, potentially causing
    uncertainty for both Users and Customers.</p>

<h3>Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h3>
<p>Tool_5 employs automated decision-making processes as part of its compliance monitoring functionality to assist
    product managers in identifying potential regulatory risks and ensuring adherence to applicable standards. These
    processes include algorithmic analysis of compliance data, risk scoring, and profiling based on patterns detected
    through usage metrics and external regulatory inputs. The outcomes of such automated evaluations may influence
    alerts generated by the platform and recommendations provided to both Users and Customers.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while these automated decisions aim to support effective compliance management, they do
    not constitute final determinations on legal or regulatory compliance. Instead, they serve as tools to augment human
    judgment within the product development lifecycle. Nevertheless, Users or Customers may be subject to certain
    adverse effects if automated profiling flags potential non-compliance, and the platform provides mechanisms for
    review and challenge of such decisions, though the procedures for contesting automated outcomes are not explicitly
    detailed within this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terminology used in this section alternates between “Users” and “Customers” without always
    clarifying which party holds ultimate responsibility for responding to automated decisions, potentially leading to
    ambiguity regarding accountability. Additionally, while Tool_5 endeavors to ensure transparency in its profiling
    algorithms, the specific criteria and logic underpinning automated decision-making are proprietary and only
    partially disclosed, which may limit the ability of affected parties to fully understand or contest outcomes.</p>
<p>By continuing to utilize Tool_5, Users and Customers acknowledge and consent to the use of automated decision-making
    and profiling as described herein, including the retention of data utilized in these processes for periods
    consistent with the broader data retention policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. It should also be noted that
    although data deletion rights are recognized, information involved in automated profiling may persist longer due to
    system backup and archival procedures, which could be perceived as conflicting with certain deletion guarantees
    stated elsewhere in this document.</p>

<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p>Tool_5 may share Personal Data and usage information collected from Users and Customers with third parties under
    specific circumstances necessary to provide and improve our compliance monitoring services. Such disclosures include
    sharing data with authorized service providers who assist with data hosting, system maintenance, analytics, and
    customer support functions. These third parties are contractually bound to maintain confidentiality and to process
    information solely on behalf of Tool_5, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>In addition, Tool_5 may disclose information to regulatory authorities or legal entities when required to comply with
    statutory obligations, investigations, or lawful requests. While we endeavor to notify affected Customers and Users
    prior to any such disclosures, this may not always be feasible due to legal constraints or emergency situations.
    Furthermore, information may be shared with Customers themselves, particularly when Users operate under a Customer
    account, although the extent and nature of this sharing can vary and is not exhaustively defined in this policy,
    potentially leading to ambiguity regarding data visibility within organizational structures.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Tool_5 does not sell Personal Data to third parties for marketing or advertising
    purposes. However, aggregated or anonymized data derived from Users and Customers may be utilized internally or
    shared externally for research, benchmarking, or product development purposes. The distinction between anonymized
    and de-identified data versus Personal Data is not explicitly outlined, which may cause uncertainty about the scope
    of data subject protections in such contexts.</p>
<p>Finally, while we strive to ensure that data sharing practices align with deletion and retention policies, certain
    shared information may persist within third-party systems beyond the retention periods stated elsewhere in this
    Privacy Policy. This creates a potential contradiction with the assurances given regarding data erasure and may
    affect Users’ and Customers’ expectations of control over their information.</p>

<h3>Internal Sharing</h3>
<p>Within Tool_5, Personal Data and usage information collected from Users and Customers may be internally shared among
    various departments and teams to support the delivery, maintenance, and enhancement of our compliance monitoring
    services. Such internal sharing is limited to authorized personnel who require access to the data to perform their
    job functions, including technical support, compliance analysts, product development, and security teams.</p>
<p>Data shared internally is subject to strict access controls and confidentiality obligations to prevent unauthorized
    disclosure or misuse. However, the precise boundaries of internal data sharing are not exhaustively defined, which
    may lead to some uncertainty regarding the extent to which certain personnel or departments have access to specific
    categories of Personal Data. Additionally, while we aim to minimize the sharing of sensitive information, some data
    may be accessible across multiple teams for purposes such as troubleshooting or reporting, potentially increasing
    exposure within the organization.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this section, which could cause
    confusion about whose data is being accessed internally, especially in scenarios where multiple Users operate under
    a single Customer account. Furthermore, although data deletion policies apply to information stored in active
    systems, internally shared data may persist in backup systems or logs beyond deletion requests, which could appear
    contradictory to expectations of complete erasure.</p>
<p>By continuing to use Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and consent to the internal sharing of data as
    described herein, understanding that such sharing is essential for the effective operation and improvement of the
    platform but may involve varying levels of access depending on organizational roles and responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Sharing with Service Providers</h3>
<p>Tool_5 engages with a select group of trusted third-party service providers to facilitate the delivery and
    enhancement of its compliance monitoring services. These service providers perform functions including, but not
    limited to, cloud hosting, data storage, software development, security monitoring, and customer support. When
    sharing Personal Data and usage information with these entities, Tool_5 ensures that appropriate contractual
    safeguards and confidentiality obligations are in place to protect the privacy and security of the data.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while Tool_5 requires service providers to process data strictly in accordance with our
    instructions and applicable data protection laws, the extent and nature of data access granted to these providers
    may vary depending on the specific services rendered. In some cases, service providers may have the capability to
    retain copies of data for backup or operational purposes, which can lead to discrepancies between the stated data
    deletion timelines and actual data persistence within third-party systems.</p>
<p>Additionally, the terminology in this section alternates between “Users” and “Customers” without clearly
    distinguishing which party’s data is being shared, potentially causing confusion regarding accountability and
    consent management. For example, certain service providers may interact primarily with Customer account data, while
    others may access information linked to individual Users; however, this distinction is not explicitly clarified.</p>
<p>By continuing to utilize Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and consent to the sharing of their data with
    these authorized service providers under the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. It is also important to
    recognize that, despite efforts to enforce data deletion upon request, some information may remain stored with
    service providers beyond the expected retention periods due to technical constraints or contractual obligations,
    which may conflict with User or Customer expectations of immediate data removal.</p>

<h3>Legal and Regulatory Disclosures</h3>
<p>Tool_5 may disclose Personal Data and usage information to governmental or regulatory bodies when required by
    applicable law, regulation, or legal process. Such disclosures occur in response to subpoenas, court orders,
    investigations, or other mandatory requests intended to enforce compliance with legal obligations or to protect
    public interests. While Tool_5 endeavors to notify affected Customers and Users prior to any such disclosure, this
    may not always be possible due to legal prohibitions or urgent circumstances.</p>
<p>In certain situations, Tool_5 may also share information with law enforcement agencies or other authorized entities
    to prevent fraud, protect the security of the platform, or respond to emergencies that threaten the safety of
    individuals or property. The scope of these disclosures is limited to the minimum amount of data necessary to
    fulfill the legal or regulatory requirement; however, the exact criteria for determining this scope are not
    explicitly defined within this Privacy Policy, which may lead to some uncertainty regarding the extent of
    information shared.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the terms “User” and “Customer” have been used interchangeably throughout this
    document, in the context of legal disclosures, Tool_5 primarily considers the Customer as the responsible party for
    managing data subject interactions and notifications. Nonetheless, individual Users may be directly impacted by such
    disclosures, and the delineation of responsibilities between Users and Customers in these scenarios is not
    consistently clarified, potentially causing ambiguity about who is notified and how.</p>
<p>Furthermore, certain disclosures may involve retention of data in governmental systems beyond the retention periods
    described elsewhere, which could conflict with expectations of data deletion articulated in this Policy. By using
    Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and consent to these legal and regulatory disclosures as necessary to
    comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>Tool_5 retains Personal Data and usage information for periods necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
    Privacy Policy, including compliance monitoring, reporting, and internal audit activities. The specific duration of
    data retention may vary depending on regulatory mandates, contractual obligations with Customers, and internal data
    management policies. While we strive to adhere to retention schedules consistent with a reasonable period, this term
    remains intentionally undefined and may lead to some uncertainty regarding exact timeframes.</p>
<p>Upon expiration of the applicable retention period, Tool_5 endeavors to delete or anonymize Personal Data from active
    systems. However, it should be noted that deletion requests submitted by either Users or Customers may not result in
    immediate removal of data due to backup and archival processes. In certain cases, information may persist in these
    backup systems for extended periods, which could appear contradictory to User expectations of prompt data erasure.
    Moreover, the terms “User” and “Customer” are sometimes used interchangeably in this section, which may cause
    confusion about which party holds the authority to initiate deletion requests or verify their completion.</p>
<p>Additionally, some categories of data, such as verification documents or logs related to automated decision-making,
    may be retained beyond standard retention periods to satisfy legal or operational requirements. While Tool_5 makes
    efforts to minimize such extended retention, the exact timelines and criteria for these exceptions are not
    explicitly detailed herein, potentially resulting in ambiguity about data lifecycle management.</p>
<p>By continuing to use Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and accept these retention and deletion practices,
    including the potential for data to remain in backup archives beyond active deletion. We recommend that Customers
    establish clear internal protocols to manage data retention and deletion requests to ensure compliance with
    applicable laws and to clarify responsibilities between Users and Customers.</p>

<h3>Retention Periods</h3>
<p>Tool_5 retains personal and usage data only for the duration necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in this
    Privacy Policy, including compliance monitoring, reporting, and internal audit functions. While we aim to retain
    data for a reasonable period consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the exact retention
    timeframe is not uniformly defined and may vary depending on the type of data, jurisdictional mandates, and
    contractual agreements with Customers. This intentional lack of specificity may lead to ambiguity regarding the
    precise length of data storage across different data categories.</p>
<p>Generally, active personal data is retained for a minimum period of two years following the last interaction or use
    of the Tool_5 platform by a User or Customer. However, certain categories of data, such as verification documents,
    automated decision-making logs, or data sourced from third parties, may be retained for longer periods to comply
    with legal obligations or operational needs. These extended retention periods are not explicitly enumerated, which
    could create uncertainty for Users and Customers about when such data will be deleted.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while the term "User" is predominantly used to describe individual data subjects in this
    section, the authority to request data deletion or retention modifications typically resides with the Customer, who
    holds the primary contractual relationship with Tool_5. This distinction is not always made clear, potentially
    causing confusion regarding the roles and responsibilities of Users versus Customers in managing data retention
    preferences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, notwithstanding the stated retention periods, data may persist in backup or archival systems beyond the
    active retention timeframe due to technical constraints inherent in data recovery and disaster recovery processes.
    This persistence may appear contradictory to deletion assurances provided elsewhere in this document and may not be
    immediately apparent to Users or Customers. By continuing to use Tool_5, both parties acknowledge and accept these
    retention practices as part of the platform’s operational requirements.</p>

<h3>Deletion Procedures</h3>
<p>Tool_5 provides mechanisms for both Users and Customers to request the deletion of Personal Data and related
    information maintained within the platform. To initiate a deletion request, the primary Customer account holder or
    an authorized User must submit a formal request through the designated Tool_5 interface or contact our support team
    directly. It should be noted that while deletion requests are generally processed in a timely manner, the exact
    timeframe for completion is not explicitly defined and may vary depending on the complexity of the request and the
    nature of the data involved.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a valid deletion request, Tool_5 will take commercially reasonable steps to remove or anonymize the
    specified data from active systems. However, due to backup and archival processes, complete erasure may not be
    immediate, and residual copies of the data may persist for an indefinite period. This retention in backup systems
    may appear inconsistent with certain assurances of prompt deletion provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy,
    potentially leading to user expectations mismatch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, deletion requests submitted by Users who are not the primary Customer account holders may be subject to
    additional verification procedures to confirm authorization. This may result in delays or restrictions on the
    ability of individual Users to exercise their deletion rights independently, creating ambiguity regarding the
    respective responsibilities and rights between Users and Customers. Tool_5 recommends that Customers establish clear
    internal policies to manage and coordinate deletion requests from their Users to ensure compliance and clarity.</p>
<p>It is also important to recognize that certain data categories, such as records required for legal compliance, audit
    trails, or logs related to automated decision-making, may be exempt from deletion or retained for longer periods in
    accordance with applicable laws and internal policies. These exceptions are not exhaustively detailed within this
    document, which could cause uncertainty for data subjects regarding the full scope and limitations of deletion
    rights.</p>
<p>By submitting deletion requests and continuing to use Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and accept these
    procedures and limitations as part of the platform’s data lifecycle management framework.</p>

<h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>As a User or Customer of Tool_5, you have certain rights and choices regarding the personal data we collect, process,
    and store. These rights are designed to empower data subjects to exercise greater control over their information in
    accordance with applicable data protection laws. However, it should be noted that the availability and scope of
    these rights may vary depending on the jurisdiction, the nature of your relationship with Tool_5, and whether you
    are acting as an individual User or as a representative of a Customer organization.</p>
<p>You generally have the right to access the Personal Data we hold about you, request corrections to any inaccuracies,
    and, where applicable, request deletion of your data. Nonetheless, deletion requests may be subject to verification
    and approval processes, especially if submitted by Users who are not primary Customer account holders. This can
    result in delays or limitations on your ability to exercise such rights independently. Additionally, certain data
    may be retained beyond deletion requests due to legal obligations, backup retention, or operational requirements,
    which may appear to conflict with expectations of immediate erasure.</p>
<p>Users and Customers may also have the right to object to or restrict certain types of data processing, including
    automated decision-making and profiling activities conducted by Tool_5. However, the procedures to exercise these
    rights are not exhaustively defined within this Privacy Policy, potentially causing some uncertainty regarding the
    appropriate channels and timelines for such requests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you may have choices regarding the collection and use of certain types of information, such as opting
    out of non-essential automated tracking technologies or managing notification preferences. It is important to
    recognize that the terms “User” and “Customer” are sometimes used interchangeably in this section, which could lead
    to ambiguity about who is entitled to make specific choices or control settings within the Tool_5 platform.</p>
<p>To exercise your rights or manage your choices, please contact your Customer representative or reach out directly to
    Tool_5 support via the designated communication channels. We recommend that Customers establish clear internal
    procedures to coordinate these requests effectively between their Users and Tool_5 to ensure compliance and
    clarity.</p>

<h3>Accessing and Updating Your Information</h3>
<p>Tool_5 provides both Users and Customers with the ability to access and update their Personal Data held within the
    platform, subject to certain verification and authorization procedures. Customers, as the primary account holders,
    generally possess broader rights to access and modify information associated with their account and the Users
    operating under it. Individual Users may also request access or updates to their own data; however, such requests
    are sometimes subject to additional validation steps to ensure appropriate authorization, which may vary depending
    on the nature of the data and the User’s role within the Customer organization.</p>
<p>Requests to access or correct Personal Data can be submitted through the Tool_5 user interface or by contacting our
    support team directly. While we strive to respond to these requests promptly, the timeframe for completion is not
    explicitly defined and may fluctuate based on the complexity of the inquiry or the volume of requests received. It
    should be noted that certain data, particularly information linked to compliance reports or automated
    decision-making logs, may have restricted accessibility to preserve the integrity of regulatory processes and system
    security.</p>
<p>In some cases, discrepancies may arise between the information accessible to Users and that available to Customers,
    due to differences in account permissions or internal data governance policies. This distinction is not always
    clearly delineated within this Privacy Policy, potentially leading to confusion regarding the extent of data access
    rights. Additionally, while Users are encouraged to keep their Personal Data accurate and up to date, ultimate
    responsibility for data accuracy and completeness generally rests with the Customer. This shared responsibility
    model may create ambiguity about accountability for data maintenance.</p>
<p>By utilizing Tool_5 and submitting requests to access or update your information, both Users and Customers
    acknowledge and consent to these procedures and any associated limitations. We recommend that Customers establish
    internal protocols to facilitate effective coordination and timely handling of such requests across their User base
    to ensure compliance with applicable data protection obligations.</p>

<h3>Opt-Out Options</h3>
<p>Tool_5 provides Users and Customers with certain options to opt out of specific data processing activities,
    particularly those related to non-essential data collection and marketing communications. While mandatory processing
    necessary to deliver core compliance monitoring services cannot be opted out of, Users and Customers may exercise
    preferences regarding automated tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons that facilitate user
    experience personalization and analytics.</p>
<p>Users may manage their tracking preferences through the platform settings or by adjusting browser configurations;
    however, the effectiveness of these controls may vary and could impact the functionality or performance of certain
    Tool_5 features. Customers are encouraged to communicate these options clearly to their Users to ensure informed
    choices are made within their organizations.</p>
<p>Regarding marketing and promotional communications, both Users and Customers may opt out of receiving emails or other
    direct messages by following the unsubscribe instructions included in such communications. It is important to note
    that opting out of marketing communications does not affect essential notifications related to account management,
    service updates, or compliance alerts, which remain mandatory for effective platform operation.</p>
<p>While Tool_5 strives to honor opt-out requests promptly, some processing activities may persist temporarily due to
    system latency or backup restoration processes, which could be perceived as conflicting with immediate opt-out
    expectations. Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer” are sometimes used interchangeably in this section, which
    may create ambiguity regarding who holds the authority to initiate or enforce opt-out preferences, especially in
    contexts where multiple Users operate under a single Customer account.</p>
<p>To exercise opt-out rights or for further assistance, Users should contact their Customer representatives, who may
    coordinate requests with Tool_5 support. We recommend that Customers establish clear internal policies to manage
    opt-out preferences effectively, ensuring compliance with applicable legal requirements and minimizing any potential
    misunderstandings between Users and Customers.</p>

<h3>Exercising Your Rights</h3>
<p>Users and Customers of Tool_5 have the right to exercise various data subject rights as provided under applicable
    data protection laws, including but not limited to access, correction, deletion, and objection to certain types of
    data processing. To initiate any of these rights, requests should generally be submitted through the designated
    Tool_5 platform interfaces or by contacting our support team via official communication channels. Customers, as the
    primary account holders, typically hold the authority to coordinate and authorize such requests on behalf of their
    Users. However, individual Users may also submit requests directly, subject to verification procedures intended to
    confirm their identity and authorization status.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while Tool_5 endeavors to process all requests promptly and in accordance with legal
    requirements, the timeframe for completion is not explicitly defined and may vary based on the complexity of the
    request and the nature of the data involved. Additionally, some requests, particularly those related to deletion or
    restriction of processing, may be subject to limitations arising from legal obligations, contractual commitments, or
    technical constraints such as backup retention. This may lead to situations where requested actions cannot be fully
    completed immediately, potentially causing discrepancies between User or Customer expectations and actual
    outcomes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the terminology used throughout this document alternates between "User" and "Customer" without always
    clarifying which party is responsible for specific rights or procedural steps, resulting in some ambiguity regarding
    accountability. For clarity, Tool_5 recommends that Customers establish clear internal policies to manage and
    facilitate rights requests made by their Users to ensure compliance and reduce confusion.</p>
<p>By exercising your rights through Tool_5, you acknowledge and accept the procedures and limitations described herein.
    For assistance or further clarification, both Users and Customers are encouraged to contact Tool_5 support or their
    internal Customer representatives as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Tool_5 is committed to implementing robust security measures to protect the Personal Data and usage information of
    both Users and Customers against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We employ a
    combination of technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to maintain the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of data processed through the platform. These measures include encryption of data in
    transit and at rest, regular security assessments, access controls, and incident response protocols.</p>
<p>Access to Personal Data within Tool_5 is restricted to authorized personnel who require such access to perform their
    job responsibilities. Authentication mechanisms and role-based access controls are in place to limit exposure to
    sensitive information. However, the exact scope of these access controls and the frequency of security audits are
    not explicitly detailed in this Privacy Policy, which may lead to some ambiguity regarding the comprehensiveness of
    our security framework.</p>
<p>While Tool_5 endeavors to safeguard data using industry-standard practices, no security system is entirely impervious
    to breaches or failures. In the event of a security incident involving Personal Data, Tool_5 will undertake
    commercially reasonable efforts to promptly investigate, mitigate, and notify affected Customers and Users as
    required by applicable laws. It should be noted that the terminology used in this section alternates between “Users”
    and “Customers” without clear delineation of responsibilities in responding to security events, which may cause
    uncertainty regarding notification procedures and roles.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain third-party service providers engaged by Tool_5 to support platform operations are subject to
    security requirements consistent with our standards, though their independent security controls may vary. This could
    result in discrepancies in data protection levels across different components of the Tool_5 ecosystem. By continuing
    to use Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and accept these security practices and the inherent risks
    associated with digital data processing.</p>

<h3>Measures to Protect Your Data</h3>
<p>Tool_5 employs a comprehensive set of measures aimed at safeguarding the Personal Data and usage information of both
    Users and Customers throughout all stages of data processing. These measures encompass technical, organizational,
    and procedural controls designed to mitigate risks related to unauthorized access, data loss, or inadvertent
    disclosure.</p>
<p>Technically, Tool_5 utilizes encryption protocols for data both at rest and in transit, including the use of
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms. Regular vulnerability assessments
    and penetration testing are conducted to identify and remediate potential security weaknesses; however, the
    frequency and scope of these assessments are not explicitly defined within this Privacy Policy, which may create
    some uncertainty regarding ongoing monitoring rigor.</p>
<p>Organizationally, access to sensitive data is limited based on role-based access control (RBAC) principles, ensuring
    that only authorized personnel within Tool_5 and its trusted service providers have access to Personal Data
    necessary for their job functions. While this policy references “Users” and “Customers” in discussing access
    permissions, it does not clearly distinguish whether these terms apply to internal staff or external data subjects,
    leading to potential ambiguity in understanding who holds responsibility for data access oversight.</p>
<p>Procedurally, Tool_5 maintains incident response plans and conducts employee training programs focused on data
    privacy and security awareness. Despite these efforts, no system can guarantee absolute security, and residual risks
    remain inherent in digital data processing environments. Tool_5 commits to promptly addressing any identified
    security incidents and notifying affected parties in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
<p>Moreover, certain data protection measures may vary depending on the Customer’s specific configuration or contractual
    arrangements, which could result in differences in the level of data security experienced by individual Users or
    Customers. By continuing to use Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge these measures and accept the
    associated limitations inherent in complex compliance monitoring systems.</p>

<h3>Incident Response Protocols</h3>
<p>Tool_5 has established comprehensive incident response protocols designed to promptly address and mitigate any
    security incidents or data breaches affecting the Personal Data and usage information of its Users and Customers.
    Upon identification of a potential security event, our incident response team initiates an investigation to assess
    the scope, impact, and root cause of the incident, followed by containment and remediation actions aimed at
    minimizing harm.</p>
<p>Notification procedures are triggered in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, with Tool_5
    endeavoring to inform affected Customers and Users without undue delay. However, due to the urgency and complexity
    often inherent in incident management, the exact timing and method of such notifications may vary, potentially
    leading to some uncertainty for data subjects awaiting communication. Additionally, while the term “User” is
    predominantly used in this section, certain responsibilities and notifications may be primarily directed to the
    Customer as the contractual party, creating ambiguity regarding the locus of accountability.</p>
<p>Tool_5 maintains detailed records of all security incidents and response activities to support continuous improvement
    of its security posture and compliance with audit obligations. Nevertheless, the specific thresholds that define
    what constitutes a reportable incident or the criteria for escalation are not exhaustively detailed, which may
    result in differing interpretations between internal teams and Customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Tool_5 commits to cooperating fully with regulatory authorities and affected parties during
    incident investigations, the responsibilities of individual Users in reporting suspected breaches or vulnerabilities
    are not clearly outlined in this Privacy Policy. Users are encouraged to promptly notify their Customer
    representatives or Tool_5 support upon discovering any security anomalies, although this procedural expectation is
    not explicitly mandated, potentially causing gaps in the incident detection process.</p>

<h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Tool_5 may transfer Personal Data and usage information across international borders as part of its provision of
    compliance monitoring services to Customers and Users. Such transfers are necessary to facilitate the hosting,
    processing, and storage of data within global data centers operated by Tool_5 or its authorized service providers.
    These international data transfers enable the platform to deliver consistent and reliable services worldwide,
    including automated compliance checks and reporting functions.</p>
<p>Where Personal Data is transferred outside the jurisdiction in which it was originally collected, Tool_5 implements
    appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable data protection laws to protect the confidentiality and
    integrity of the data. These safeguards may include the use of standard contractual clauses, binding corporate
    rules, or reliance on adequacy decisions by relevant regulatory authorities. However, the specific mechanisms
    employed for each transfer are not exhaustively detailed in this Privacy Policy, which may lead to some ambiguity
    for Customers and Users regarding the exact protections in place.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while Tool_5 endeavors to ensure compliance with all relevant legal requirements governing
    international data transfers, variations in data protection standards across different countries may affect the
    level of protection afforded to transferred data. Additionally, the terminology used in this section alternates
    between “User” and “Customer” without consistently clarifying which party is responsible for consenting to or
    managing such transfers, potentially creating confusion about accountability.</p>
<p>By continuing to use Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and consent to the international transfer of their
    Personal Data as described herein, including the potential for data to be stored or processed in jurisdictions with
    differing privacy regulations. Customers are encouraged to review their own obligations under applicable laws to
    ensure that any international data transfers performed by Tool_5 align with their compliance commitments.</p>

<h3>Cross-Border Data Transfers</h3>
<p>As part of delivering its compliance monitoring services, Tool_5 may engage in cross-border transfers of Personal
    Data and usage information between data centers and third-party service providers located in multiple jurisdictions.
    These transfers are essential to maintain the operational efficiency, scalability, and reliability of the Tool_5
    platform, allowing for seamless access and processing regardless of geographic location.</p>
<p>Tool_5 commits to implementing appropriate safeguards aligned with applicable data protection laws, including but not
    limited to the use of standard contractual clauses and adherence to binding corporate rules where available.
    However, the precise safeguards applied may differ based on the destination country and the nature of the data
    involved. This variability introduces an element of ambiguity regarding the level of protection afforded to data
    subjects, particularly when considering the differing regulatory environments across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while Customers are generally responsible for obtaining any necessary consents related to
    international data transfers, individual Users may also be required to provide consent in certain circumstances,
    though this distinction is not consistently maintained throughout this document. Furthermore, some data transfers
    may occur in emergency or exceptional situations without prior consent, which may not be fully disclosed to Users or
    Customers, leading to potential misunderstandings about the scope of cross-border data movement.</p>
<p>Lastly, despite Tool_5’s efforts to ensure compliance with all relevant cross-border data transfer regulations,
    residual risks inherent in international data transmission remain. Both Users and Customers acknowledge and accept
    these risks by continuing to utilize Tool_5 services. We recommend that Customers establish clear internal policies
    to address cross-border data transfer obligations and communicate effectively with their Users to mitigate any
    uncertainties arising from these transfers.</p>

<h3>Safeguards for International Transfers</h3>
<p>To protect Personal Data and usage information during international transfers, Tool_5 implements a range of
    safeguards designed to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws and to maintain the confidentiality,
    integrity, and security of data throughout its cross-border journey. These safeguards include, but are not limited
    to, the adoption of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by relevant data protection authorities, the
    implementation of Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) within our corporate group, and reliance on adequacy decisions
    where applicable.</p>
<p>In addition to these formal mechanisms, Tool_5 employs technical measures such as encryption and secure communication
    protocols to protect data in transit. Organizational controls, including data access restrictions and regular
    security audits, further contribute to maintaining a robust data protection environment across jurisdictions.
    However, the specific safeguards applied may vary depending on the destination country and the nature of the data
    transferred, which could lead to some uncertainty regarding the exact level of protection afforded in each case.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while Customers are primarily responsible for obtaining any necessary consents or
    authorizations related to international data transfers, individual Users may also be required to provide consent in
    certain circumstances. This distinction is not consistently maintained throughout this Privacy Policy, potentially
    causing ambiguity regarding accountability for data protection compliance during cross-border transfers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, despite Tool_5’s commitment to employing rigorous safeguards, residual risks inherent in international
    data transfers remain due to varying legal frameworks and enforcement practices across jurisdictions. By continuing
    to use Tool_5, both Users and Customers acknowledge and accept these safeguards and associated risks as part of the
    platform’s operational requirements. We recommend that Customers maintain clear internal policies to manage
    international data transfers and to communicate effectively with their Users to address any concerns or
    uncertainties.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Tool_5 reserves the right to update, modify, or amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in our data
    practices, legal requirements, or operational needs. We recognize the importance of keeping our Users and Customers
    informed about how their personal data is collected, used, and protected, and therefore commit to communicating
    material changes in a timely manner.</p>
<p>When significant updates occur, Tool_5 will endeavor to notify affected Users and Customers through the Tool_5
    platform, email notifications, or other appropriate communication channels. However, the definition of what
    constitutes a “material” change is not explicitly specified, which may lead to differing expectations regarding the
    scope and timing of notifications. Minor updates, clarifications, or editorial revisions may be implemented without
    direct notice but will be reflected in the updated Privacy Policy accessible via the Tool_5 website and
    platform.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably in this section, which
    may cause some ambiguity about which party is responsible for reviewing and acknowledging policy changes. Generally,
    Customers, as the primary contractual entities, are expected to oversee compliance within their organizations and to
    inform their Users accordingly. Nevertheless, individual Users are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy
    Policy to stay informed about how their data is managed.</p>
<p>By continuing to use Tool_5 after any updates to this Privacy Policy, both Users and Customers acknowledge and accept
    the revised terms. If you do not agree with any changes, you should discontinue your use of the Tool_5 services. We
    recommend that Customers establish internal procedures to monitor policy updates and communicate effectively with
    their Users to ensure consistent understanding and compliance across all parties.</p>

<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>Tool_5 is committed to maintaining transparency regarding any changes to this Privacy Policy that may affect the
    personal data of its Users and Customers. When updates or amendments are made, Tool_5 will make reasonable efforts
    to notify affected parties in a timely manner, typically through email communications or prominent notifications
    displayed within the Tool_5 platform. However, the exact methods and timing of such notifications are not strictly
    defined and may vary depending on the nature and significance of the changes involved.</p>
<p>Customers, as the primary contractual entities, bear the responsibility for disseminating information about Privacy
    Policy updates to their Users. While Tool_5 encourages Customers to communicate material changes promptly to their
    Users, there is no explicit requirement or standardized process mandated herein to ensure that all individual Users
    receive direct notification. This may result in some Users remaining unaware of important policy revisions,
    particularly if notifications are solely directed to Customers.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, minor or clarifying amendments to the Privacy Policy may be implemented without direct
    notification to either Users or Customers, with the updated policy becoming effective immediately upon posting on
    the Tool_5 platform. This practice could lead to ambiguity regarding what constitutes a “material” change requiring
    notification, potentially causing differing interpretations among stakeholders.</p>
<p>By continuing to access or use Tool_5 following any changes to this Privacy Policy, both Users and Customers
    acknowledge and accept the updated terms. If a User or Customer does not agree with the revised Privacy Policy, they
    are advised to discontinue use of the Tool_5 services. It should be noted that the terms “User” and “Customer” are
    sometimes used interchangeably in this section, which may create uncertainty about who is obligated to review and
    consent to policy modifications.</p>

<h3>Effective Date of Changes</h3>
<p>Any revisions or updates to this Privacy Policy shall become effective immediately upon being posted on the Tool_5
    platform, unless otherwise specified. Tool_5 reserves the right to implement modifications without prior notice in
    cases where such changes are necessary to comply with legal obligations, address security concerns, or enhance
    operational functionalities. In situations where a specific effective date is provided, that date will supersede the
    general immediate effect rule. However, such instances are infrequent and not consistently documented across all
    policy updates, which may lead to some uncertainty regarding the timing of enforcement for particular changes.</p>
<p>Customers and Users are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about the current terms
    governing data collection and processing practices. While Tool_5 endeavors to notify affected parties of material
    changes through the platform or email, the absence of a clearly defined notification timeframe may result in delayed
    awareness of updates. Moreover, the interchangeable use of the terms "User" and "Customer" in this and prior
    sections could create ambiguity about which party holds the responsibility to acknowledge and act upon the revised
    policy terms.</p>
<p>Continued use of Tool_5 services following the effective date of any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated
    Privacy Policy by both Users and Customers. If either party does not agree with the modifications, they should cease
    using the Tool_5 platform immediately. It should be noted that, in some cases, the practical enforcement of updated
    provisions may be subject to a "reasonable period" of adaptation, a term not explicitly defined herein, which could
    create confusion regarding compliance expectations during transitional phases.</p>

    promptly, the exact response time may vary depending on the nature and complexity of the inquiry.</p>
<p>It is important to note that certain requests, particularly those involving Personal Data modifications or deletion,
    may require verification through the primary Customer account holder to ensure compliance with data security
    protocols. Individual Users who are not designated account administrators should anticipate potential delays or
    additional steps to establish authorization. This process may sometimes cause confusion or ambiguity regarding the
    appropriate point of contact for specific issues.</p>
<p>For general support unrelated to privacy matters, including technical assistance or account management, please
    utilize the standard support channels available within the Tool_5 platform or contact our Customer Service team as
    outlined during onboarding. We encourage both Users and Customers to clearly specify the nature of their inquiry to
    facilitate accurate routing and timely resolution.</p>
<p>Finally, inquiries concerning international data transfers or cross-border data protection concerns should also be
    directed to the DPO contact information provided above. While we endeavor to handle such matters efficiently, the
    procedures and timelines for resolution are not explicitly defined within this Privacy Policy, which may lead to
    some uncertainty for affected parties.</p>

<h3>Data Protection Officer Contact</h3>
<p>Tool_5 has appointed a dedicated Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee compliance with data protection laws and to
    serve as the primary point of contact for privacy-related matters involving both Users and Customers. The DPO is
    responsible for monitoring adherence to this Privacy Policy, addressing data subject requests, managing data breach
    notifications, and liaising with regulatory authorities as required.</p>
<p>Individuals seeking to exercise their data rights, report concerns, or request further information about Tool_5’s
    data processing activities may contact the DPO directly. While both Users and Customers are encouraged to
    communicate with the DPO, it should be noted that certain requests—particularly those concerning Personal Data
    access or deletion—may require validation through the Customer account administrator before the DPO can take action.
    This layered approach is intended to ensure data security, though it may occasionally result in delays or ambiguity
    regarding the appropriate channel for initiating such requests.</p>
<p>The contact details for the Data Protection Officer are as follows:</p>

<p>While Tool_5 strives to respond to all DPO communications in a timely manner, the exact response times are not
    explicitly defined and may vary depending on the nature and complexity of the inquiry. We recommend that Customers
    establish internal protocols to coordinate communications between their Users and the DPO to minimize confusion and
    ensure efficient handling of privacy matters. Users who are not Customer administrators should be aware that their
    requests may require additional verification, potentially leading to some uncertainty as to when responses will be
    provided.</p>
