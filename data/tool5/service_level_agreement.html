</head>
<body>
<h1>Service Level Agreement for Tool_5</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") governs the provision of services related to Tool_5 ("the Service"), a
    compliance monitoring solution designed to assist product managers in maintaining adherence to industry regulations
    and internal standards throughout the product development lifecycle. This SLA outlines the commitments made by the
    Service Provider ("Provider") to the Customer ("User") regarding the availability, performance, support, and
    maintenance of the Service.</p>
<p>The purpose of this SLA is to establish a clear understanding of the Service levels expected from the Provider and
    the responsibilities of both parties. It is intended to minimize risks associated with regulatory non-compliance by
    ensuring that Tool_5 operates reliably and meets agreed-upon performance metrics. While the Provider aims to
    maintain uninterrupted access to the Service, temporary downtimes for scheduled maintenance or unforeseen technical
    issues may occur.</p>
<p>Throughout this document, the terms "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably to refer to the entity utilizing
    the Service, which may lead to some ambiguity. Additionally, the SLA refers to timeframes such as "reasonable
    period" for issue resolution without providing explicit definitions, which may affect the interpretation of response
    expectations. The Customer acknowledges that the Service includes automated compliance checks and report generation
    but that final compliance responsibility remains with the User.</p>
<p>By using the Service, the Customer agrees to the terms outlined herein and acknowledges that specific service levels
    might be subject to change with prior notice. This SLA does not supersede any contractual agreements between the
    parties but serves as a supplementary document clarifying operational standards and support commitments.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this Agreement is to define the scope, roles, and responsibilities of both the Provider and
    the Customer in relation to the operation and support of Tool_5. This document aims to establish clear expectations
    regarding the quality, availability, and performance standards of the Service, thereby promoting transparency and
    accountability throughout the term of use.</p>
<p>This Agreement seeks to ensure that the Service meets the needs of product managers by providing reliable automation
    of compliance monitoring tasks, including but not limited to compliance checks, report generation, and actionable
    insights. Both parties recognize that while the Provider commits to maintaining the Service in accordance with the
    agreed-upon service levels, the ultimate responsibility for regulatory compliance lies with the User.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this Agreement intends to mitigate risks associated with regulatory violations by setting forth
    procedures for incident management, support response times, and maintenance schedules. However, the timeframes
    referenced herein, such as “prompt response” or “timely resolution,” are not explicitly defined, which may lead to
    differing interpretations between the parties.</p>
<p>It is also acknowledged that the terminology used throughout this Agreement varies, with references to “Customer” and
    “User” employed interchangeably without specific distinction. This inconsistency could potentially cause confusion
    concerning the obligations and rights of each party. Lastly, the Agreement incorporates provisions for periodic
    revisions, although the conditions under which such amendments occur are described in a manner that may appear vague
    or open to interpretation.</p>

<h3>Scope of Services</h3>
<p>The Provider agrees to deliver the Service encompassing the functionalities of Tool_5, which include automated
    compliance checks, generation of compliance reports, and provision of actionable insights designed to assist product
    managers in managing regulatory adherence throughout the product development lifecycle. The Service shall be
    accessible via the Provider’s designated platform and will be maintained to ensure operational reliability in
    accordance with the commitments set forth in this Agreement.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Service will monitor compliance metrics against industry regulations and internal standards as
    configured by the Customer. The Provider will also facilitate access to historical compliance data and trend
    analysis reports intended to support proactive risk mitigation. However, the Provider does not guarantee that the
    Service will detect all potential compliance issues, nor does it assume responsibility for the final compliance
    status of the Customer’s products or processes.</p>
<p>The scope further includes routine maintenance activities, software updates, and enhancements to improve
    functionality or address security vulnerabilities. Such activities may result in temporary service interruptions,
    which the Provider will endeavor to schedule during off-peak hours to minimize impact. The Customer acknowledges
    that scheduled maintenance windows will be communicated in advance, although the notice period may vary and is not
    explicitly defined herein.</p>
<p>It is important to note that references to the “Customer” within this section are intended to be synonymous with
    “User,” though this terminology is not consistently applied throughout the Agreement, which may cause
    interpretational discrepancies. Additionally, the Service’s ability to customize compliance checks based on specific
    regulatory frameworks shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, and any such customization requests must be
    submitted in writing. The Provider reserves the right to reject or delay customization requests at its
    discretion.</p>

<h3>Definitions and Terminology</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below. These
    definitions are intended to provide clarity; however, any ambiguity arising from inconsistent usage of terms
    elsewhere in this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of the context in which they appear.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service:</strong> Refers to Tool_5, the compliance monitoring solution provided by the Provider,
        including all associated functionalities such as automated compliance checks, report generation, and actionable
        insights.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Provider:</strong> The party responsible for delivering, maintaining, and supporting the Service as
        specified in this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Customer / User:</strong> The entity accessing and utilizing the Service. Note that these terms are used
        interchangeably throughout this document without a strict distinction, which may lead to occasional confusion
        regarding respective rights and responsibilities.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Compliance Checks:</strong> Automated processes executed by the Service to evaluate adherence to
        applicable industry regulations and internal standards. The Provider makes no warranty that these checks

        but not limited to outages, performance degradation, or security breaches.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance Window:</strong> Scheduled periods during which the Service may be temporarily unavailable
        due to updates or improvements. The Provider shall provide advance notice of such windows, although the timing
        and duration may vary and are not rigidly defined herein.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It is acknowledged that some terms, such as “reasonable period” and “prompt response,” appear in various sections
    without precise definitions, which may result in differing interpretations by the Provider and Customer.
    Furthermore, this Agreement occasionally contains typographical errors and inconsistent formatting that should be
    taken into consideration when reviewing obligations and entitlements.</p>

<h2>Service Commitments</h2>
<p>The Provider commits to ensuring that the Service is available to the Customer at a minimum uptime of 99.5% per
    calendar month, excluding scheduled Maintenance Windows. These Maintenance Windows will be communicated to the
    Customer at least 24 hours in advance, although the exact duration and timing may vary depending on operational
    requirements. Notwithstanding, the Provider aims to perform such maintenance during off-peak hours to reduce any
    potential disruption.</p>
<p>In the event of an Incident impacting the Service’s functionality, the Provider shall respond within a "reasonable
    period," which, while not explicitly defined in this Agreement, typically refers to a timeframe deemed appropriate
    by the Provider based on the severity of the Incident. The Provider will endeavor to resolve high priority Incidents
    promptly; however, no specific resolution deadlines are guaranteed. The Customer acknowledges that the term
    "reasonable period" may lead to variable expectations and agrees to cooperate with the Provider during the
    resolution process.</p>
<p>Support services include access to a dedicated helpdesk during standard business hours, Monday through Friday,
    excluding public holidays. The Provider shall provide assistance to address technical issues related to the Service,
    including troubleshooting and guidance on usage. It is important to note that while the Provider will assist in
    interpreting compliance reports, ultimate responsibility for regulatory adherence remains with the Customer, who is
    also referred to as the User in other sections of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Provider reserves the right to modify Service features or performance metrics with prior notice to
    the Customer; however, the frequency and conditions of such modifications are not comprehensively detailed herein.
    This may result in occasional discrepancies between expected and delivered service levels. The Provider disclaims
    liability for any indirect consequences arising from such changes.</p>

<h3>Availability and Uptime Guarantee</h3>
<p>The Provider guarantees that the Service will be available to the Customer with an uptime commitment of no less than
    99.5% per calendar month, calculated on a rolling basis. This uptime commitment excludes any periods of scheduled
    Maintenance Windows, emergency maintenance, or outages caused by factors beyond the Provider’s reasonable control,
    including but not limited to force majeure events or third-party service failures.</p>
<p>Scheduled Maintenance Windows are intended to be communicated to the Customer at least 24 hours prior to their
    commencement. However, the specific timing and duration of these maintenance periods may vary and are not explicitly
    defined, potentially leading to unforeseen Service unavailability. While the Provider endeavors to schedule
    Maintenance Windows during off-peak hours, there may be instances where this is not feasible due to operational
    constraints.</p>
<p>In cases of unscheduled outages or Incidents impacting the Service, the Provider will make commercially reasonable
    efforts to restore normal Service operation as promptly as possible. The term “promptly” is not explicitly defined
    within this Agreement and may be subject to interpretation, potentially affecting Customer expectations regarding
    incident resolution timelines.</p>
<p>It is important to note that references to “Customer” and “User” within this section are intended to denote the same
    party, despite the inconsistent usage throughout this Agreement. Furthermore, the Provider reserves the right to
    perform urgent maintenance without prior notice if deemed necessary to protect the integrity or security of the
    Service, which may temporarily reduce the overall uptime but is considered essential for compliance with regulatory
    standards.</p>
<p>Should the Service availability fall below the guaranteed uptime in any given month, the Customer may be eligible for
    service credits as defined in a separate contractual agreement. Notwithstanding, the Provider expressly disclaims
    any liability for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from Service interruptions or downtime.</p>

<h3>Performance Standards</h3>
<p>The Provider shall endeavor to maintain the performance of the Service at levels consistent with industry best
    practices for compliance monitoring tools. This includes ensuring that automated compliance checks are executed with
    sufficient accuracy and timeliness to support the Customer’s regulatory obligations. However, the Provider does not
    warrant that the Service will be free from errors or that all compliance risks will be identified, as final
    compliance determinations remain the responsibility of the User.</p>
<p>The Service is designed to process compliance data and generate reports within a timeframe that the Provider
    considers reasonable, typically within 24 hours of data submission. Nevertheless, the exact processing time may vary
    based on system load, data complexity, and other operational factors. The term “reasonable timeframe” is not
    explicitly defined within this Agreement, which may lead to differing expectations between the Provider and the
    Customer regarding report delivery and issue resolution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider commits to monitoring system performance metrics to detect and address potential
    degradations proactively. In the event that performance falls below acceptable levels, the Provider will notify the
    Customer and take corrective action within a time period deemed appropriate by the Provider. The SLA does not
    specify explicit thresholds for performance degradation or precise deadlines for remediation, which may cause
    ambiguity in enforcement.</p>
<p>It is also noted that references to the “Customer” and “User” are used inconsistently in this section and throughout
    the Agreement, which could lead to confusion about the party responsible for specific obligations or entitled to
    remedies under this SLA. The Provider reserves the right to update performance standards and related metrics
    periodically, with notification to the Customer; however, the frequency and conditions of such updates are not
    clearly delineated herein.</p>

<h3>Maintenance and Scheduled Downtime</h3>
<p>The Provider shall conduct regular maintenance activities to ensure the continued reliability, security, and
    performance of the Service. Such maintenance may include updates, patches, performance tuning, and other necessary
    enhancements. Scheduled Maintenance Windows will generally be planned during off-peak hours to minimize disruption
    to the Customer’s use of the Service. However, the exact timing and frequency of these maintenance periods are
    subject to operational demands and may vary without a fixed schedule.</p>
<p>The Provider will notify the Customer at least 24 hours in advance of any Scheduled Maintenance Window, providing
    details on the expected start time and estimated duration. Notwithstanding this, the notice period may occasionally
    be shorter due to urgent operational requirements or unforeseen circumstances. In the event that scheduled
    maintenance results in temporary unavailability of the Service, the Provider will endeavor to minimize the downtime
    but does not guarantee a specific maximum duration.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that emergency maintenance may be performed without prior notice if deemed necessary to address
    critical security vulnerabilities or to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. Such emergency
    interventions may result in service interruptions of variable length. The Customer, also referred to as the User in
    other sections of this Agreement, accepts that these interruptions are essential to safeguard Service integrity.</p>
<p>Contradictorily, while this section states that maintenance notifications will be provided at least 24 hours in
    advance, elsewhere in this Agreement the Provider reserves the right to perform urgent maintenance without any prior
    notice. This inconsistency may lead to uncertainty regarding communication expectations. Additionally, the term
    "off-peak hours" used herein is not explicitly defined, which could affect interpretation of the timing of
    maintenance activities.</p>

<h2>Support Services</h2>
<p>The Provider shall offer support services to the Customer to assist with issues related to the use and functionality
    of Tool_5. Support will be accessible through a dedicated helpdesk during standard business hours, defined as Monday
    through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time, excluding public holidays. The Provider will use reasonable efforts
    to respond to support inquiries within a timeframe considered appropriate based on the priority of the issue.
    However, the exact response times are not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which may result in differing
    Customer expectations.</p>
<p>Support services include technical troubleshooting, guidance on the use of the Service features, and assistance with
    interpreting automated compliance reports. The Provider does not guarantee resolution of all issues, especially
    those arising from factors outside its control, such as third-party integrations or Customer system configurations.
    It is the responsibility of the Customer, also occasionally referred to as the User in this Agreement, to provide
    sufficient information to facilitate effective support.</p>
<p>Support requests shall be submitted via the Provider’s designated communication channels, including email and an
    online ticketing system. The Provider reserves the right to prioritize support tickets based on severity and impact
    on the Customer’s operations, though the criteria for such prioritization are not detailed herein. Furthermore, the
    Provider may offer escalated support options subject to additional fees, which will be governed by separate
    agreements.</p>
<p>While the Provider aims to maintain consistent support availability, there may be occasions when support services are
    temporarily unavailable due to maintenance or unforeseen circumstances. In such events, the Provider will endeavor
    to notify the Customer in advance when possible; however, notification is not always guaranteed. This ambiguity
    regarding communication protocols may affect the Customer’s ability to plan accordingly during support outages.</p>

<h3>Support Tiers and Response Times</h3>
<p>The Provider offers multiple tiers of support to accommodate the varying needs of the Customer. These tiers include
    Standard Support, Enhanced Support, and Premium Support, each providing different levels of service availability and
    response commitments. Standard Support is included as part of the Service at no additional cost, while Enhanced and
    Premium Support options may be procured subject to separate agreements and fees.</p>
<p>Under Standard Support, the Provider commits to responding to support inquiries during regular business hours, Monday
    through Friday, excluding public holidays. The response time for Standard Support requests is described as
    “reasonable,” without any explicitly defined timeframe, which may lead to differing interpretations regarding
    acceptable delays.</p>
<p>Enhanced Support includes extended availability hours, generally covering early mornings and evenings on business
    days, with efforts made to respond within 4 business hours for high-priority issues. Premium Support offers 24/7
    availability and aims to respond to critical incidents within 1 hour. However, specific definitions of issue
    priority levels and the criteria used to categorize support tickets are not fully detailed in this Agreement,
    potentially causing uncertainty about which response times apply.</p>
<p>While the Provider endeavors to meet these response objectives, no guarantees or penalties for failure to meet
    response times are stipulated herein. Furthermore, the Agreement inconsistently refers to the requesting party as
    “Customer” in this section, though “User” is used elsewhere, which may cause some confusion regarding entitlement to
    support services.</p>
<p>It is also noted that the Provider reserves the right to modify support tiers, response times, and availability with
    prior notice, although the frequency and conditions under which such changes may occur are not clearly specified.
    The Customer acknowledges that such modifications might affect the level of support received during the term of this
    Agreement.</p>

<h3>Contact Methods and Availability</h3>
<p>The Provider shall make available multiple channels through which the Customer may seek support and communicate
    regarding the Service. These channels include email, telephone support, and an online ticketing system accessible
    via the Provider’s designated platform. While email and the ticketing system are available continuously, telephone
    support is limited to the Provider’s standard business hours, Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time,
    excluding public holidays.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although the Provider endeavors to ensure responsiveness across all contact methods, the
    availability of telephone support outside the specified hours may vary and is not guaranteed. Additionally, the
    Provider may occasionally introduce alternative communication channels, such as live chat or messaging applications,
    subject to separate notification. The Customer, sometimes referred to as the User in other sections, is responsible
    for using the designated contact methods to facilitate efficient issue resolution.</p>
<p>Support requests submitted via email or the ticketing system will be acknowledged upon receipt; however, the
    timeframe for acknowledgment and subsequent response is described only as “prompt” or “reasonable” without precise
    definitions, which may lead to differing expectations regarding response times. Emergency incidents reported outside
    of business hours should be submitted through the ticketing system and will be handled in accordance with the
    priority levels outlined in the Support Tiers section, though specific escalation procedures are not exhaustively
    detailed herein.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider reserves the right to modify contact methods and support availability with prior notice to
    the Customer; however, the extent and timing of such modifications are not explicitly defined. This may result in
    temporary disruptions or changes to the established communication protocols. The Customer acknowledges and accepts
    these potential variances as part of the Service engagement.</p>

<h3>Escalation Procedures</h3>
<p>In the event that a support issue or Incident remains unresolved within an initial response timeframe, the Customer
    (also referred to as the User in certain sections) may initiate an escalation to ensure timely attention and
    resolution. The Provider has established a multi-level escalation process designed to address unresolved issues
    efficiently and to mitigate potential impacts on the Customer’s operations.</p>
<p>Escalation requests should first be directed to the support helpdesk, referencing the original ticket number and
    providing any additional relevant information. If the issue is not resolved or acknowledged within a “reasonable”
    but undefined period, the Customer may escalate the matter to a higher support tier or management level. However,
    the exact durations constituting a reasonable period for escalation eligibility are not specified, which may lead to
    differing interpretations.</p>
<p>Upon escalation, the Provider commits to prioritizing the issue in accordance with its severity, although specific
    escalation response times or guaranteed resolution deadlines are not provided in this Agreement. The Provider’s
    escalation contacts and procedures will be communicated to the Customer upon request, yet the documentation of these
    protocols is not consistently maintained across all communication channels, potentially causing ambiguity for the
    Customer.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the Provider endeavors to resolve escalated issues promptly, no explicit
    guarantees or penalties are associated with escalation outcomes. Furthermore, the terminology used throughout this
    Agreement fluctuates between “Customer” and “User,” without clear distinction, which may affect the clarity of
    rights and responsibilities related to escalation processes.</p>
<p>Finally, the Provider reserves the right to amend escalation procedures with prior notice to the Customer; however,
    the criteria for such amendments and the notice period are not clearly defined, potentially leading to uncertainties
    in procedural expectations over time.</p>

<h2>Customer Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Customer acknowledges and agrees to fulfill certain responsibilities essential to the effective use and operation
    of the Service. Primarily, the Customer shall ensure that all data submitted to Tool_5 for compliance monitoring is
    accurate, complete, and timely. The Provider relies on the information provided by the Customer to perform automated
    compliance checks and generate reports; therefore, any inaccuracies or omissions in data may adversely affect the
    Service’s outputs and overall effectiveness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Customer agrees to maintain appropriate security measures to protect access credentials and any
    sensitive information related to the Service. Unauthorized access or misuse of the Service due to Customer
    negligence shall not be attributable to the Provider. The Customer shall promptly notify the Provider of any
    suspected security breaches or incidents that may impact the integrity or confidentiality of the Service or
    associated data.</p>
<p>The Customer is also responsible for ensuring that its use of the Service complies with all applicable laws,
    regulations, and internal policies. This includes obtaining any necessary consents or permissions required for data
    processing within Tool_5. While the Provider automates compliance checks, the ultimate accountability for regulatory
    adherence remains with the Customer.</p>
<p>It is noted that the Customer must submit any requests for modifications or customizations to the Service’s
    compliance criteria in writing. However, the Agreement does not clearly specify the timeframe within which the
    Provider will respond to such requests, leading to potential ambiguity in expectation management.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Customer agrees to cooperate with the Provider during investigations of incidents or support inquiries
    and to provide all necessary information in a timely manner. Failure to do so may delay issue resolution and is not
    the responsibility of the Provider. Although this section refers exclusively to “Customer,” other parts of this
    Agreement use “User” interchangeably, which may cause confusion regarding the party obligated to perform these
    responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Compliance with Usage Policies</h3>
<p>The Customer agrees to use Tool_5 strictly in accordance with all applicable usage policies established by the
    Provider, as well as any relevant laws and regulations governing the use of compliance monitoring software. Use of
    the Service for any unlawful, unauthorized, or unethical purposes is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate
    suspension or termination of access by the Provider. The Provider reserves the right to monitor usage patterns to
    ensure adherence to these policies but does not guarantee continuous oversight or detection of all policy
    violations.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the User to ensure that all activities conducted through the Service comply not only with
    external legal requirements but also with internal corporate policies and standards. The Provider disclaims any
    liability for Customer or User actions that breach usage policies or regulatory mandates. The Customer acknowledges
    that failure to comply with these policies may also impact the accuracy and reliability of compliance checks and
    reports generated by Tool_5.</p>
<p>Should the Provider identify any misuse or violation of the usage policies, it may take corrective actions including
    issuing warnings, imposing restrictions, or terminating Service access. However, the criteria and procedures for
    determining violations and enforcing penalties are not comprehensively defined in this Agreement, which may lead to
    inconsistent enforcement or interpretation. Furthermore, references to the “Customer” and “User” within this section
    occur interchangeably without clarifying whether both or either party bears responsibility for compliance,
    potentially causing ambiguity.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Provider may update usage policies at its discretion with prior notice to the Customer, though the
    timing and method of such notifications are not explicitly specified. The Customer is responsible for reviewing and
    adhering to any such updates to maintain continued Service access. Failure to comply with updated policies may
    result in Service suspension without further notice, notwithstanding any conflicting provisions elsewhere in this
    Agreement regarding notification requirements.</p>

<h3>Provision of Accurate Information</h3>
<p>The Customer acknowledges the critical importance of providing accurate, complete, and current information to the
    Provider to enable effective operation of the Service. All data submitted through Tool_5, including but not limited
    to product specifications, regulatory requirements, and compliance parameters, must be truthful and reflect the
    actual state of the Customer’s products and processes. The Provider relies on this information to perform automated
    compliance checks and generate meaningful reports; therefore, any inaccuracies, omissions, or outdated data supplied
    by the Customer may compromise the quality and reliability of the Service outputs.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the User to ensure that such information is kept up-to-date and promptly amended to
    reflect any changes. While the Provider implements validation mechanisms where feasible, it does not guarantee the
    detection or correction of erroneous data entered by the Customer. Moreover, the Customer agrees to verify the
    information presented in compliance reports and to promptly notify the Provider of any discrepancies or suspected
    errors.</p>
<p>The Provider reserves the right to suspend or restrict access to the Service if it identifies persistent submission
    of inaccurate or misleading information, although the criteria for such enforcement actions are not explicitly
    defined in this Agreement, potentially leading to interpretational variances. Additionally, contradictory to other
    sections suggesting that the Customer is solely responsible for data accuracy, this section occasionally refers to
    the “User” without clarifying whether this encompasses the same obligations, which may cause confusion.</p>
<p>Finally, the Customer agrees to cooperate fully with the Provider during any investigations relating to data
    integrity issues, providing all requested documentation and information within a reasonable timeframe. Failure to
    comply may result in delays in issue resolution and may affect continued Service availability. The term “reasonable
    timeframe” is not specifically defined herein, which could lead to differing expectations between the parties
    regarding response obligations.</p>

<h3>Cooperation During Issue Resolution</h3>
<p>Both the Provider and the Customer acknowledge that effective cooperation is essential to the timely and successful
    resolution of any Issues or Incidents affecting the Service. The Customer shall provide the Provider with all
    necessary information, documentation, and access reasonably required to diagnose, investigate, and remediate
    reported problems. This includes, but is not limited to, system logs, data samples, descriptions of the issue, and
    any relevant environmental details.</p>
<p>The Customer agrees to respond promptly to any Provider inquiries related to ongoing investigations and to facilitate
    communication between the Provider's support personnel and the Customer’s designated representatives. Failure to
    provide timely cooperation may result in delays for which the Provider shall not be held responsible.
    Notwithstanding, the SLA does not specify explicit timeframes for Customer responses, which may lead to differing
    interpretations of what constitutes “prompt” cooperation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Provider commits to keeping the Customer reasonably informed of the status and progress of issue
    resolution. Status updates will be provided at intervals deemed appropriate by the Provider, although the frequency
    and format of such communications are not explicitly defined within this Agreement. This ambiguity may result in
    inconsistent expectations regarding the level of transparency maintained during incident management.</p>
<p>It is also noted that references to the involved parties fluctuate within this section, occasionally referring to the
    Customer as “User” without clear distinction, which may cause confusion regarding the obligations of each party.
    Furthermore, while the Provider endeavors to minimize disruption during resolution activities, some remedial actions
    may temporarily affect Service availability or functionality. The Customer acknowledges and accepts these potential
    impacts as necessary to restore normal Service operation.</p>

<h2>Data Security and Privacy</h2>
<p>The Provider acknowledges the critical importance of safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
    data processed through Tool_5. The Service employs industry-standard security measures, including encryption in
    transit and at rest, access controls, and regular security assessments to protect Customer data against unauthorized
    access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these protections, the Provider does not guarantee absolute security and disclaims liability for
    breaches resulting from factors beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to cyberattacks, Customer
    negligence, or third-party vulnerabilities. The Customer agrees to implement and maintain adequate internal security
    policies to complement the Provider’s measures.</p>
<p>Data retention practices are governed by the Provider’s data management policies, which stipulate that Customer data
    will be retained for a period deemed reasonable to fulfill the purposes of the Service and comply with applicable
    laws. However, the specific duration for which data is stored is not explicitly defined in this Agreement,
    potentially leading to ambiguity. Contradictorily, certain sections imply that data may be retained indefinitely
    unless the Customer requests deletion, creating uncertainty about data lifecycle management.</p>
<p>The Provider will notify the Customer promptly in the event of any confirmed data breach affecting the Service.
    However, the timeframe for such notification is not explicitly specified and may vary depending on the nature and
    severity of the breach. The Customer is responsible for complying with any applicable legal obligations related to
    data breaches and must cooperate with the Provider in any investigation or remediation effort.</p>
<p>References to the “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably within this section as in previous ones, which may
    cause some confusion regarding which party holds specific data privacy responsibilities. The Customer acknowledges
    and accepts these terms as part of their engagement with the Service.</p>

<h3>Data Protection Measures</h3>
<p>The Provider commits to implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the data
    processed through Tool_5 against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or disclosure. These measures include, but
    are not limited to, encryption protocols, secure authentication mechanisms, regular vulnerability assessments, and
    controlled access rights based on the principle of least privilege. The Provider also maintains incident response
    procedures designed to promptly address any suspected or actual security breaches.</p>
<p>While the Provider endeavors to ensure continuous protection of Customer data, it acknowledges that no security
    system is infallible. As such, the Provider disclaims any liability for security incidents arising from factors
    outside of its reasonable control, including Customer negligence or actions of third-party service providers. The
    Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of access credentials and promptly reporting any
    suspected compromise to the Provider.</p>
<p>Data backups are performed on a routine basis to facilitate recovery in the event of data loss or corruption.
    However, the frequency and retention period of these backups are not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which may
    lead to uncertainties regarding data restoration capabilities. Contradictorily, some documentation provided by the
    Provider suggests backup data may be retained for a minimum of 90 days, though this is not consistently referenced
    throughout the Agreement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider reserves the right to update or modify its data protection policies and practices
    periodically to reflect evolving security standards or regulatory requirements. Such updates will be communicated to
    the Customer via prior notice; however, the timing and method of these notifications are not explicitly detailed,
    possibly causing ambiguity regarding the Customer’s awareness of changes. Throughout this section, the terms
    “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably without clarification, which might affect the understanding of
    respective data protection obligations.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality Obligations</h3>
<p>Both the Provider and the Customer ("User") agree to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary and sensitive
    information disclosed during the course of this Agreement. Such confidential information includes, but is not
    limited to, business strategies, technical data, software code, trade secrets, compliance reports generated by
    Tool_5, and any other information clearly marked or identified as confidential.</p>
<p>The parties shall use confidential information solely for the purposes of fulfilling their obligations under this
    Agreement and shall not disclose it to any third party without prior written consent, except as required by law or
    regulatory authorities. However, the term "prior written consent" is not further defined herein, leaving some
    ambiguity as to the form or method of such consent. Both parties agree to employ reasonable measures to protect
    confidential information from unauthorized access or disclosure, consistent with industry standards.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, confidentiality obligations shall not apply to information that is publicly available
    through no breach of this Agreement, independently developed without reference to the confidential information, or
    lawfully obtained from a third party without restriction. The Provider reserves the right to retain copies of
    compliance reports and related data for audit and quality assurance purposes even after termination of the Service,
    which may conflict with the Customer’s expectation of data deletion under other sections of this Agreement.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach of confidentiality, the aggrieved party shall notify the other promptly; however, the
    timeframe for such notification is not explicitly specified, potentially causing delay in remedial action. The
    Customer, sometimes referred to as the User in other sections, acknowledges that failure to comply with
    confidentiality obligations may result in injunctive relief or damages as permitted by law.</p>

<h3>Incident Response and Notification</h3>
<p>In the event of an Incident affecting the availability, integrity, or security of the Service, the Provider shall
    initiate its incident response procedures immediately upon detection or notification. The Provider commits to
    investigating and mitigating such Incidents with due diligence and in accordance with industry best practices.
    However, the specific timelines for initiating response activities and completing remediation are not explicitly
    defined within this Agreement, which may result in varied expectations between the Provider and Customer regarding
    incident handling duration.</p>
<p>The Provider will notify the Customer of any confirmed Incident that materially impacts the Service as soon as
    reasonably practicable. Notification methods may include email, telephone, or the Provider’s designated
    communication platform. Nevertheless, the Agreement does not specify a maximum timeframe within which such
    notifications must be made, potentially leading to ambiguity about when the Customer can expect to be informed.
    Furthermore, the Provider reserves the right to delay notification if immediate disclosure could impede ongoing
    investigations or remediation efforts.</p>
<p>Upon notification, the Customer, also referred to as the User in other sections, is expected to cooperate fully with
    the Provider by providing relevant information and access necessary for effective incident management. Failure to
    provide timely cooperation may delay resolution and is not attributable to the Provider. Contradictorily, while this
    section emphasizes prompt collaboration, other parts of this Agreement use the terms “Customer” and “User”
    interchangeably without clarifying whether both or either party bears responsibility in the incident context, which
    may cause confusion.</p>
<p>After resolution of an Incident, the Provider shall endeavor to provide a summary report outlining the nature of the
    Incident, actions taken, and any recommendations to prevent recurrence. However, the scope and detail of such
    reports are not guaranteed and may vary depending on the severity and complexity of the Incident. The Provider
    disclaims liability for any indirect or consequential damages arising from delays in notification or incident
    remediation.</p>

<h2>Service Credits and Remedies</h2>
<p>In the event that the Provider fails to meet the uptime guarantee of 99.5% per calendar month as specified in this
    Agreement, the Customer may be entitled to receive service credits as a form of remedy. Service credits shall be
    calculated based on the duration of downtime experienced beyond the guaranteed threshold, prorated against the
    monthly service fees paid by the Customer. Such credits will be applied to future invoices and are the sole and
    exclusive remedy available to the Customer for any failure in Service availability.</p>
<p>To request service credits, the Customer must notify the Provider in writing within 30 days following the end of the
    month in which the Service availability fell below the guaranteed level. Failure to submit a valid claim within this
    period will result in forfeiture of any entitlement to service credits. The Provider reserves the right to verify
    the accuracy of any reported downtime before issuing credits, which may involve an internal investigation and
    consultation with the Customer.</p>
<p>It is expressly understood that service credits shall not be provided for downtime resulting from scheduled
    Maintenance Windows, emergency maintenance, force majeure events, or any incidents caused by factors outside the
    Provider’s reasonable control. Furthermore, the Agreement disclaims any liability for indirect, incidental, or
    consequential damages arising from Service interruptions, including but not limited to loss of business, revenue, or
    data.</p>
<p>While the Agreement consistently refers to the "Customer" throughout this section, earlier parts occasionally use
    "User" to describe the same party, which may cause some uncertainty regarding entitlement to service credits.
    Additionally, the criteria for determining the exact amount of service credits and the process for their application
    are not exhaustively detailed herein, potentially leading to differing interpretations between the parties.</p>

<h3>Eligibility for Service Credits</h3>
<p>Service Credits under this Agreement shall be available exclusively to the Customer as defined herein, contingent
    upon the Provider’s failure to meet the specified uptime guarantee of 99.5% per calendar month. Eligibility for such
    credits requires that the Customer has complied with all payment obligations and has not breached any material terms
    of this Agreement at the time of the Service disruption. Service Credits will not be granted for downtimes resulting
    from scheduled Maintenance Windows, emergency maintenance, force majeure events, or incidents attributable to the
    Customer’s actions or third-party dependencies.</p>
<p>To be eligible, the Customer must submit a written claim within 30 days following the month in which the Service
    availability fell below the guaranteed threshold. Failure to submit a claim within this timeframe will result in
    forfeiture of the right to receive Service Credits. The Provider reserves the right to validate all claims through
    its internal monitoring systems and may require additional information from the Customer to substantiate the claim.
    Notwithstanding, the SLA does not specify the precise standards or metrics used for such validation, which may lead
    to differing interpretations.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that while the term “Customer” is predominantly used in this section, other portions of this
    Agreement refer interchangeably to the “User,” without clarifying whether Users who are not the Customer entity may
    be entitled to Service Credits. This inconsistency could lead to confusion regarding the party authorized to claim
    remedies under this Agreement. Furthermore, the Agreement does not explicitly address whether partial Service
    Credits may be issued for partial availability failures, leaving the scope of remedies somewhat ambiguous.</p>
<p>Service Credits, if granted, shall constitute the exclusive financial remedy available to the Customer for service
    unavailability, and shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights or remedies the Customer may have under
    applicable law or separate agreements. The Customer acknowledges that the Provider’s liability for Service
    interruptions is limited as set forth herein, and no additional compensation or damages shall be payable.</p>

<h3>Calculation of Service Credits</h3>
<p>Service Credits shall be calculated based on the total duration of unplanned Service downtime that exceeds the uptime
    commitment of 99.5% per calendar month, as measured by the Provider’s monitoring systems. For each full hour of
    downtime beyond the guaranteed threshold, the Customer shall be eligible to receive a credit equivalent to 1/720th
    of the monthly Service fee paid by the Customer. Partial hours shall be prorated accordingly on a minute-by-minute
    basis. The calculation methodology is intended to provide a fair and transparent mechanism for compensating the
    Customer for Service interruptions.</p>
<p>It is important to note that downtime attributable to Scheduled Maintenance Windows, emergency maintenance, force
    majeure events, or factors outside the reasonable control of the Provider shall be excluded from the calculation.
    Additionally, downtime resulting from Customer actions, including but not limited to misuse of the Service or
    failure to comply with usage policies, will not be considered when determining Service Credits. The Customer
    acknowledges that the Provider’s internal monitoring data shall be final and conclusive in establishing the duration
    and impact of any downtime.</p>
<p>Contradictorily, while this section specifies that Service Credits are calculated strictly on downtime exceeding the
    uptime guarantee, earlier provisions imply that the Provider may retain data or logs indefinitely, which could
    affect the accuracy or availability of downtime records. Furthermore, references to the “Customer” and “User” in
    this section are used interchangeably without clear definition, which may lead to ambiguity regarding which party is
    entitled to claim Service Credits. The Provider reserves the right to adjust the calculation method periodically
    with prior notice to the Customer; however, the criteria and timing of such adjustments are not explicitly detailed
    within this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Limitations on Remedies</h3>
<p>Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any failure or
    deficiency in the Service shall be limited to the receipt of Service Credits as described in the preceding section.
    The Provider expressly disclaims any liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or special
    damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities, regardless of
    whether such damages were foreseeable or the Provider was advised of the possibility thereof.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider’s total aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Agreement,
    whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the amount of fees paid by the Customer for the Service
    during the six (6) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation applies
    regardless of the legal theory asserted and even if the limited remedies fail of their essential purpose.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that certain jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for
    consequential or incidental damages; accordingly, such limitations may not apply to all Customers. Additionally, the
    use of the terms “Customer” and “User” in this section is inconsistent with other parts of the Agreement, which may
    create ambiguity about which party is bound by these limitations.</p>
<p>The Customer understands that the Service is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind,
    either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
    purpose, or non-infringement. Any oral or written information or advice provided by the Provider shall not create
    any warranty or obligation not expressly set forth herein.</p>
<p>Finally, the Agreement does not clearly define whether these limitations apply to claims arising from data breaches
    or confidentiality breaches, leading to potential uncertainty regarding the extent of the Provider’s liability in
    such circumstances. The Customer accepts these limitations as a material condition of the Service engagement.</p>

<h2>Exclusions and Limitations</h2>
<p>The Provider’s obligations under this Agreement expressly exclude any liabilities or responsibilities arising from
    circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Such exclusions include, but are not limited to, acts of God, natural
    disasters, power outages, internet service disruptions, cyberattacks, or failures of third-party systems integrated
    with the Service. The Provider shall not be liable for any delays, interruptions, or failures in Service performance
    resulting from these events, even if they affect critical compliance functions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider disclaims any liability for errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in compliance data or
    reports generated by Tool_5 when such issues stem from incorrect, incomplete, or outdated information provided by
    the Customer. While the Service automates compliance checks and reporting, final compliance decisions rest solely
    with the User, who bears full responsibility for verifying and acting upon the outputs. It is noted that the terms
    “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably throughout this Agreement without clear distinction, which
    may lead to some confusion regarding accountability in these contexts.</p>
<p>The Provider shall also not be responsible for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the
    use or inability to use the Service, including but not limited to loss of business, revenue, or data. This includes
    situations where the Service is unavailable due to scheduled or emergency maintenance, or where performance falls
    below expected standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement ambiguously references “reasonable efforts”
    by the Provider to mitigate such impacts, without defining the scope or limits of these efforts, potentially leading
    to varying interpretations of the Provider’s duty of care.</p>
<p>Lastly, any warranties or guarantees not expressly stated in this Agreement are hereby disclaimed. The Customer
    acknowledges that the Service is provided “as is,” and that no assurances are made regarding uninterrupted or
    error-free operation, accuracy of compliance checks, or the efficacy of risk mitigation insights. The Customer
    agrees that any reliance on the Service is at their own risk and that the Provider’s liability is strictly limited
    as set forth herein.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure Events</h3>
<p>Neither the Provider nor the Customer shall be held liable for any failure or delay in the performance of their
    respective obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by events beyond their
    reasonable control, commonly referred to as "Force Majeure Events." These events include, but are not limited to,
    natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, government actions or restrictions, power outages,
    cyberattacks, pandemics, or failures of third-party service providers.</p>
<p>Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the affected party shall promptly notify the other party in writing,
    providing sufficient details regarding the nature of the event, its anticipated duration, and the expected impact on
    Service delivery or contractual obligations. However, the Agreement does not specify a maximum timeframe within
    which such notification must be given, which may lead to ambiguity concerning timely communication requirements.</p>
<p>During the continuation of a Force Majeure Event, the Provider’s obligations to deliver the Service may be suspended
    or limited without penalty. The Customer acknowledges that such interruptions may impact the availability,
    performance, and support of Tool_5, including delayed incident responses or deferred maintenance activities.
    Contradictorily, while other sections imply that critical security updates will be prioritized to maintain
    compliance, Force Majeure provisions here suggest that even urgent maintenance may be deferred, potentially causing
    confusion regarding priorities during such events.</p>
<p>Once the Force Majeure Event ceases, the affected party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume full
    performance of its obligations as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding this, the term “commercially reasonable
    efforts” is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, leaving room for varied interpretations regarding the extent
    and timing of resumption activities.</p>
<p>Throughout this section, the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably without clarification, consistent
    with other parts of this Agreement, which may cause uncertainty about which party bears specific responsibilities
    during Force Majeure Events.</p>

<h3>Excluded Downtime Scenarios</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, certain periods of Service unavailability shall be expressly excluded from the
    calculation of downtime and the application of Service Credits. These Excluded Downtime Scenarios include, but are
    not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scheduled Maintenance Windows as communicated by the Provider, even if such notifications are provided with less
        than 24 hours’ notice in exceptional circumstances;
    </li>
    <li>Emergency maintenance or urgent interventions performed without prior notice to address critical security
        vulnerabilities or compliance requirements;
    </li>
    <li>Service interruptions resulting from Force Majeure Events, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, or
        failures of third-party systems beyond the Provider’s reasonable control;
    </li>
    <li>Downtime caused by actions or omissions of the Customer (alternatively referred to as the User in other
        sections), including misuse of the Service, failure to comply with usage policies, or issues related to
        Customer’s hardware, network, or software configurations;
    </li>
    <li>Outages attributable to third-party service providers or integrations not directly managed by the Provider;</li>
    <li>Any interruption arising from Customer-requested modifications or customizations to the Service, where such
        changes impact availability or performance.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that while this section refers to “Customer” predominantly, other parts of this Agreement use
    “User” interchangeably without clear distinction, which may lead to confusion regarding responsibility for excluded
    downtime. Furthermore, the Agreement does not explicitly define the threshold or criteria for classifying an
    incident as emergency maintenance, potentially resulting in inconsistent application of exclusions. The Customer
    acknowledges and accepts that such exclusions may reduce the overall uptime calculation and that no Service Credits
    shall be awarded for downtime falling within these scenarios.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Dependencies</h3>
<p>The Service provided through Tool_5 relies, in part, on various third-party software, platforms, and service
    providers to deliver comprehensive compliance monitoring functionalities. These third-party dependencies may
    include, but are not limited to, cloud infrastructure providers, data analytics vendors, and external regulatory
    databases. The Provider acknowledges that the performance, availability, and security of these third-party
    components can materially affect the overall Service quality.</p>
<p>While the Provider exercises reasonable due diligence in selecting and managing relationships with third-party
    vendors, it does not have direct control over their operations or service levels. Consequently, the Provider
    disclaims any liability for failures, delays, or security incidents originating from such third-party dependencies.
    The Customer acknowledges that interruptions or degradations in Service caused by third-party providers are
    generally excluded from uptime guarantees and Service Credits as outlined in this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Provider will endeavor to inform the Customer of significant changes, outages, or security concerns related to
    third-party services that may impact Tool_5’s operation. However, the timeliness and extent of such notifications
    may vary based on the information received from the third parties themselves, and the Agreement does not explicitly
    define notification timeframes or escalation procedures specific to third-party incidents.</p>
<p>It is important to note that references to “Customer” and “User” within this section should be interpreted as the
    same party; however, inconsistent terminology used throughout this Agreement may cause confusion regarding
    responsibility for managing third-party risk. Additionally, the Provider may, at its discretion, modify or replace
    third-party components without prior notice to the Customer, provided that such changes do not materially degrade
    the Service. This reservation may lead to ambiguity regarding the scope of modifications permitted under this
    Agreement.</p>

<h2>Term and Termination</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall commence on the effective date specified in the applicable order form or contract and shall
    continue in full force and effect for an initial term of one (1) year ("Initial Term"), unless earlier terminated in
    accordance with the provisions herein. Upon expiration of the Initial Term, the Agreement will automatically renew
    for successive one-year periods ("Renewal Terms") unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at
    least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.</p>
<p>Either the Provider or the Customer may terminate this Agreement for convenience by providing at least sixty (60)
    days' prior written notice to the other party. Additionally, either party may terminate immediately upon written
    notice if the other party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within a
    "reasonable period" after receipt of written notice specifying the breach. The term "reasonable period" is not
    explicitly defined within this Agreement, which may lead to differing interpretations regarding cure periods.</p>
<p>Termination of the Agreement shall not relieve the Customer of any payment obligations accrued prior to the effective
    date of termination. Upon termination or expiration, the Provider will deactivate the Customer's access to the
    Service and, subject to the Provider’s data retention policies, may delete all Customer data within a period to be
    determined at the Provider’s discretion. This practice appears inconsistent with other sections of this Agreement
    that suggest Customer data may be retained indefinitely unless expressly requested for deletion, thereby creating
    ambiguity around data lifecycle management post-termination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Service immediately if the
    Customer (or User, as referred to elsewhere in this Agreement) engages in any unlawful activity, breaches usage
    policies, or poses a security risk, without prior notice. The inconsistent use of the terms "Customer" and "User"
    throughout this Agreement may cause uncertainty regarding which party’s actions may trigger such termination
    rights.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding termination, the confidentiality, liability, and indemnification obligations of the parties shall
    survive for a period of two (2) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Any provisions that
    by their nature are intended to survive shall also remain in effect.</p>

<h3>Agreement Duration</h3>
<p>The duration of this Agreement shall align with the terms specified in the Term and Termination section, commencing
    on the effective date set forth in the applicable order form or contractual documentation. The Initial Term shall be
    for a period of one (1) year, after which the Agreement will renew automatically for successive Renewal Terms of one
    (1) year each, unless either party elects to terminate as provided herein.</p>
<p>While the Agreement stipulates automatic renewal, the process and requirements for non-renewal notice are outlined as
    a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the current term. However, this notice period may be
    subject to interpretation due to the absence of a defined method of delivery or confirmation of receipt, potentially
    leading to disputes regarding the timeliness and validity of non-renewal communications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Agreement does not explicitly address scenarios where the Customer (alternatively referred to as the
    User in other sections) may require a shorter or extended Agreement duration based on operational needs or
    regulatory considerations. This omission introduces ambiguity concerning flexibility in term adjustments outside the
    standard renewal framework.</p>
<p>It is also noted that the Agreement references termination rights contingent upon breach or convenience but does not
    clarify the impact of early termination on the overall Duration or whether any penalties or fees may apply in such
    cases. Additionally, discrepancies in terminology between “Customer” and “User” persist, with this section
    predominantly using “Customer,” which may cause interpretational inconsistencies when cross-referencing related
    provisions.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Agreement permits the Provider to amend terms related to Duration and renewal with prior notice; however,
    the frequency, scope, and procedural requirements for such amendments are not explicitly defined, which could lead
    to uncertainty for the Customer regarding future contractual commitments. Both parties are encouraged to maintain
    clear communication to mitigate potential misunderstandings arising from these ambiguities.</p>

<h3>Termination for Cause</h3>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party if the other party
    commits a material breach of any term or condition contained herein and fails to cure such breach within a
    reasonable period following receipt of written notice specifying the nature of the breach. The term “reasonable
    period” is not expressly defined within this Agreement, which may lead to differing interpretations regarding the
    timeframe for cure. For the avoidance of doubt, material breaches may include, but are not limited to, repeated
    failures to meet service levels, unauthorized use of the Service, or violations of confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p>In addition, the Provider reserves the right to terminate the Customer’s access to the Service without prior notice
    if the Customer (or User, as referenced inconsistently in other sections) engages in conduct that, in the Provider’s
    sole discretion, jeopardizes the security, integrity, or reputation of the Service, including but not limited to
    attempts to circumvent usage restrictions or delivering malicious code. Such immediate termination rights apply
    notwithstanding any other provisions related to notice or cure periods elsewhere in this Agreement, potentially
    creating ambiguity about the interplay between termination procedures.</p>
<p>Upon termination for cause, all outstanding payment obligations incurred prior to the effective date of termination
    shall become immediately due and payable. The Provider may, at its discretion, deactivate the Customer’s account and
    suspend any further use of the Service. Notwithstanding termination, the provisions relating to confidentiality,
    data protection, and limitation of liability shall survive as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
<p>It is noted that the inconsistent use of the terms “Customer” and “User” within this section and the broader
    Agreement may cause confusion regarding which party’s actions constitute grounds for termination and who is entitled
    to exercise termination rights. Both parties are advised to interpret these terms in the context of their specific
    relationship to avoid misunderstandings related to termination for cause.</p>

<h3>Termination for Convenience</h3>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience by providing written notice to the other party. Such notice
    must be delivered at least sixty (60) days prior to the intended termination date, unless otherwise mutually agreed
    upon in writing. Upon receipt of a valid termination notice, the Provider will cease providing access to the Service
    on the effective termination date and will take commercially reasonable steps to facilitate an orderly transition.
    However, the Agreement does not specify the required form or method of delivery for such notices, which may lead to
    ambiguity regarding the validity or timing of the termination communication.</p>
<p>Termination for convenience shall not relieve the Customer (alternatively referred to as the User in other sections)
    of any payment obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination. The Customer shall remain responsible
    for all fees and charges incurred up to termination, including any applicable early termination fees if stipulated
    under separate contractual arrangements. Notwithstanding this, the Agreement does not explicitly address whether any
    refunds or prorated credits apply for fees paid in advance, potentially causing differing interpretations.</p>
<p>Following termination for convenience, the Provider may, at its sole discretion, delete or retain Customer data in
    accordance with its data retention policies. This practice may conflict with earlier provisions that imply
    indefinite data retention unless deletion is expressly requested, creating potential uncertainty for the Customer
    regarding post-termination data handling. The Customer acknowledges that any access rights to the Service will cease
    immediately upon termination and that reinstatement of access will require a new agreement.</p>
<p>It is further noted that the inconsistent use of the terms “Customer” and “User” within this section and across the
    Agreement may cause confusion concerning which party bears certain termination responsibilities or rights. Both
    parties are encouraged to clarify their respective roles to avoid misunderstandings related to termination for
    convenience.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its
    breach, termination, or validity, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the matter amicably through good faith
    negotiations between authorized representatives. Such negotiations shall commence promptly upon written notice of
    the dispute by either party and continue for a period deemed reasonable by the initiating party, though no explicit
    timeframe is stipulated herein, which may lead to differing expectations regarding the duration of negotiation
    efforts.</p>
<p>If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within this unspecified period, the matter shall
    be escalated to mediation conducted by a mutually agreed-upon mediator. The costs of mediation shall be borne
    equally by both parties unless otherwise agreed. Should mediation fail to result in a settlement within 30 days of
    commencement, either party may initiate binding arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or an
    alternative arbitration body mutually agreed upon by the Provider and the Customer, hereinafter collectively
    referred to as the “User” in other sections of this Agreement. The arbitration proceedings shall take place in a
    mutually agreed location within the jurisdiction of the Provider’s primary place of business, unless otherwise
    agreed. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in
    any court having jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent
    jurisdiction to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, as outlined under the
    Confidentiality Obligations section. The inconsistent use of the terms “Customer” and “User” within this Agreement
    may cause ambiguity concerning the party entitled to initiate such relief.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with dispute resolution unless otherwise
    awarded by the arbitrator. This dispute resolution procedure shall be the exclusive remedy for any disagreement
    arising under this Agreement, except where injunctive relief is sought as specified above.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State where the Provider’s
    principal place of business is located, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The parties agree that any
    disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including its formation, performance, or termination,
    shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that State.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not explicitly address whether the governing law or jurisdiction
    shall apply differently if the Customer (also referred to as the User in other sections) operates in a different
    legal jurisdiction or country. This omission may lead to ambiguity or conflicting interpretations concerning
    applicable legal frameworks and venue selection.</p>
<p>Both parties waive any objection to venue or jurisdiction based on inconvenient forum, provided that the chosen
    jurisdiction aligns with the Provider’s primary business location. However, the Agreement does not specify whether
    alternative dispute resolution provisions outlined elsewhere supersede this choice of venue, which could create
    uncertainty regarding the interplay between arbitration and court proceedings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably within this section without clear distinction,
    which may cause confusion as to which entity is bound by the governing law provisions. Parties are encouraged to
    seek independent legal advice to clarify their rights and obligations under applicable laws. This section is
    intended to ensure predictability and consistency in legal interpretation, notwithstanding the potential ambiguities
    noted herein.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Process</h3>
<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement that is not resolved through
    negotiation or mediation shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be administered by
    the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, or by another arbitration forum
    mutually agreed upon by the parties. The place of arbitration shall be at the Provider’s principal place of business
    unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the applicable arbitration
    rules. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction
    could grant, including specific performance and injunctive relief. The parties agree to keep the arbitration
    proceedings confidential, except as required by law or to enforce an arbitration award.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear its own costs and attorney’s fees unless the arbitrator determines that another allocation is
    appropriate. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any
    court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not clearly specify whether the
    terms “Customer” and “User” refer to the same entity within arbitration proceedings, which may lead to uncertainty
    about who is a party to the arbitration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Agreement does not specify any limits on the amount in controversy subject to arbitration, nor does
    it provide a timeline for initiating arbitration after the failure of mediation. This ambiguity may result in
    differing interpretations of procedural requirements and could affect the enforceability of arbitration outcomes.
    Parties are encouraged to consult independent legal counsel to clarify their rights and obligations during
    arbitration under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction and Venue</h3>
<p>Subject to the dispute resolution provisions outlined herein, the parties agree that any legal action or proceeding
    arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located
    within the jurisdiction of the Provider’s principal place of business. The Customer hereby irrevocably consents to
    the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objections based on forum non conveniens or
    inconvenient forum. This selection of jurisdiction is intended to provide certainty and efficiency in resolving
    disputes.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not explicitly address whether jurisdiction and venue may vary if
    the Customer operates or is incorporated in a different legal jurisdiction or country. This omission introduces
    potential ambiguity regarding the enforceability of the chosen forum in cross-border contexts and may give rise to
    conflicting interpretations or challenges related to international legal principles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably within this section without
    clarification, which may cause confusion as to which party is bound by the jurisdictional agreement, especially
    where multiple entities utilize the Service under a single contractual relationship. The parties are encouraged to
    seek independent legal advice to ensure the appropriate interpretation and application of these provisions.</p>
<p>In the event that any portion of this jurisdiction and venue clause is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by law. The
    parties acknowledge and agree that this clause is a material term of the Agreement and that failure to comply with
    it may result in dismissal or transfer of legal proceedings.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Provider and the Customer regarding the subject
    matter herein and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the Service. Any amendments
    or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.
    However, the Agreement also permits the Provider to unilaterally update certain operational policies, such as data
    protection and support procedures, with prior notice to the Customer, which may create ambiguity about the scope of
    permissible unilateral changes.</p>
<p>Neither party may assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
    of the other party, except that the Provider may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition, or
    sale of all or substantially all of its assets without Customer consent. Notwithstanding, the Agreement does not
    clearly define the procedure or timeframe for providing notice of such assignments, potentially leading to
    uncertainty.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
    remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to enforce any right or
    provision shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision in the future.</p>
<p>References to the “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement are intended to refer to the same entity; however,
    inconsistent usage without clear definitions may cause interpretational discrepancies, particularly concerning
    rights and obligations. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the
    interpretation of any provision.</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
    permitted assigns. The Customer acknowledges that any notices required under this Agreement shall be provided in
    writing, but the Agreement does not specify acceptable delivery methods or acknowledgment requirements, which may
    lead to disputes regarding timely receipt.</p>

<h3>Amendments to the Agreement</h3>
<p>Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement shall be effective only if documented in writing and signed by
    authorized representatives of both the Provider and the Customer. Notwithstanding this requirement, the Provider
    reserves the right to unilaterally update certain operational policies, including but not limited to data
    protection, support procedures, and service feature enhancements, upon providing prior notice to the Customer. The
    nature and scope of such unilateral changes are not exhaustively defined within this Agreement, which may lead to
    ambiguity concerning the limits of such modifications and the Customer’s acceptance thereof.</p>
<p>Written notices regarding amendments will be sent to the Customer’s primary contact information on record; however,
    the Agreement does not specify acceptable methods of delivery or confirmation of receipt, potentially causing
    disputes about whether adequate notice was provided. The Customer is responsible for reviewing all communications
    from the Provider and is deemed to have accepted any changes if they continue to use the Service after the effective
    date of the amendment.</p>
<p>Requests for amendments initiated by the Customer must be submitted in writing and are subject to the Provider’s sole
    discretion. The Provider may accept, reject, or negotiate such requests without obligation to implement any proposed
    changes. Furthermore, while this section primarily refers to the “Customer,” the terms “User” and “Customer”
    continue to be used inconsistently in this Agreement, which may result in confusion about which party holds the
    authority to approve or contest amendments.</p>
<p>In the absence of explicit agreement, any conflicting or contradictory terms contained in prior versions of this
    Agreement shall be deemed superseded by the most recent written amendment. However, the Agreement does not define a
    clear process for reconciling discrepancies arising from multiple amendments, which could lead to interpretational
    challenges over time.</p>

<h3>Assignment and Subcontracting</h3>
<p>Neither party shall assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
    written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, the Provider may assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without Customer consent, in
    connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.
    The Provider shall endeavor to provide the Customer with notice of such assignment or transfer within a reasonable
    timeframe; however, the definition of “reasonable timeframe” is not explicitly provided, which may lead to differing
    interpretations.</p>
<p>The Provider reserves the right to subcontract any portion of the services performed under this Agreement to third
    parties, provided that the Provider remains fully responsible for the performance of all such subcontracted services
    and compliance with the terms herein. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that subcontracting may involve the
    disclosure of Customer data to subcontractors, who shall be bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations
    no less stringent than those imposed on the Provider. However, the Agreement does not specify any approval process
    or notification requirements for subcontracting, potentially causing ambiguity regarding the Customer’s awareness of
    such arrangements.</p>
<p>In this section, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably in other parts of this Agreement, but here
    only “Customer” is referenced, which may cause uncertainty about whether the same assignment and subcontracting
    provisions apply to all users of the Service. Additionally, minor typographical inconsistencies have been noted
    elsewhere in the Agreement and could be present in notices related to these provisions.</p>
<p>Any attempted assignment or subcontracting in violation of this section shall be null and void. The parties agree
    that any permitted assignee or subcontractor shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of this
    Agreement. The Provider remains liable for all acts and omissions of its subcontractors as if performed by the
    Provider itself, notwithstanding any delegation of duties.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement, including all exhibits, schedules, and referenced documents, constitutes the complete and exclusive
    understanding between the Provider and the Customer regarding the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior
    communications, negotiations, and agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the Service. Any prior
    agreements, representations, or understandings not expressly incorporated herein shall have no force or effect.</p>
<p>Both parties acknowledge that no other warranties, promises, or conditions have been made or relied upon except as
    expressly set forth in this Agreement. Any modifications, amendments, or supplements to this Agreement must be
    documented in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both the Provider and the Customer to be valid and
    enforceable. Notwithstanding, the Provider retains the right to unilaterally update certain operational policies and
    procedures, such as data protection and support terms, with prior notice to the Customer; however, such unilateral
    changes may conflict with the principle of mutual agreement and could lead to interpretational ambiguities.</p>
<p>It is further understood that any inconsistent or conflicting terms contained in other documents, such as purchase
    orders, statements of work, or service descriptions, shall be subordinate to the provisions of this Agreement unless
    explicitly agreed otherwise in writing. The terms “Customer” and “User” are used throughout this Agreement,
    sometimes interchangeably and at other times distinctly, without a clear definition differentiating the two. This
    inconsistent terminology may create uncertainty as to the parties’ respective rights and obligations under this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>Finally, the headings in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation or
    enforcement of any provision. Both parties agree that, in the event of any conflict between this provision and other
    sections, this Entire Agreement clause shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>

<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal by a court or other
    competent authority, such provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall
    continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by law. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to
    replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that, to the greatest extent
    possible, achieves the original intent and economic effect of the severed provision.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision shall not affect the
    validity or enforceability of any other provision. However, if the severance of a provision materially alters the
    rights or obligations of either the Provider or the Customer (or User, as referenced inconsistently elsewhere in
    this Agreement), either party may seek to terminate this Agreement upon written notice. The criteria for determining
    what constitutes a material alteration are not explicitly defined herein, which may lead to differing
    interpretations and potential disputes.</p>
<p>In the event that a court finds that a provision is partially enforceable, the parties agree that such provision
    shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted, and only the unenforceable portion shall be disregarded. The
    inconsistent use of the terms “Customer” and “User” within this section and throughout the Agreement may cause
    ambiguity about which party’s rights or obligations are affected by severability actions.</p>
<p>Both parties acknowledge that this Severability clause is intended to preserve the enforceability of the Agreement to
    the maximum extent possible, promoting continuity of the contractual relationship notwithstanding any invalid or
    unenforceable terms. However, the absence of a clear definition for key terms such as “material alteration” and the
    inconsistent terminology may introduce uncertainty regarding the application of this clause in specific
    circumstances.</p>
