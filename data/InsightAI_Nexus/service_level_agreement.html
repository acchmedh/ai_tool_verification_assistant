<p>In addition to routine monthly reporting, the Client may request ad hoc or specialized reports, provided such requests are submitted in writing with reasonable prior notice. The Provider shall respond to such requests within ten (10) business days and shall endeavor to deliver the requested reports within a timeframe mutually agreed upon, considering the complexity and scope of the data involved. All reports shall be delivered via secure digital channels, such as encrypted email or protected portals, to ensure confidentiality and data integrity.</p>
<p>The Provider shall also provide notification of any significant deviations from agreed-upon performance standards or Service Level Objectives within one (1) business day of detection. Such notifications shall include a summary of the issue, potential impact, and proposed remedial actions. The timely delivery of these reports and notifications is essential to support the Client’s operational oversight, compliance requirements, and strategic planning activities.</p>
<p>All report contents shall be accurate, complete, and prepared in good faith, reflecting the true state of service delivery. The Parties agree that the report delivery schedule is a critical component of this SLA, and failure to adhere to it may constitute a breach, entitling the Client to applicable remedies as set forth herein.</p>

<h2>Term and Termination</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date specified herein and shall remain in full force and effect for an initial term of twelve (12) months unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section. Following the expiration of the initial term, the Agreement shall automatically renew for successive periods of twelve (12) months unless either party provides written notice of its intent not to renew at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.</p>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other party breaches any material term or condition of this SLA and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice specifying the breach. Termination for cause shall be effective immediately upon expiration of the cure period if the breach remains unremedied. Additionally, either party may terminate this Agreement without cause by providing at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the other party.</p>
<p>In the event of termination, the Provider shall, within a reasonable period, cease all services, and the Client shall pay all outstanding fees for services rendered up to the effective date of termination. Termination shall not prejudice any rights or remedies available to either party accrued prior to termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions relating to confidentiality, data security, and intellectual property rights shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Either party may also suspend or terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or otherwise ceases business operations. Termination notices shall be delivered in writing via email or registered mail to the addresses specified in the contact information section of this Agreement. All obligations incurred prior to termination shall remain enforceable, and the parties shall cooperate to ensure an orderly wind-down of services and data handling procedures.</p>

<h3>Agreement Duration</h3>
<p>The term of this SLA shall commence on the Effective Date as specified herein and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial period of twelve (12) months, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions outlined in the Term and Termination section. Upon expiration of this initial term, the Agreement shall automatically renew for successive successive periods of twelve (12) months unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. Such renewal shall be subject to any modifications or amendments mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties.</p>
<p>The Parties acknowledge that it is in their mutual interests to periodically review the terms and performance of this SLA to ensure ongoing alignment with evolving business needs and technological developments. Accordingly, both Parties agree to initiate review discussions at least ninety (90) days prior to the renewal date, during which adjustments to service levels, scope, or other contractual provisions may be considered and incorporated through written amendments.</p>
<p>Termination of this Agreement prior to the expiration of the initial or renewal term shall be governed by the provisions set forth in the Term and Termination section, including any applicable notice periods and conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations relating to confidentiality, data security, and intellectual property rights shall survive any termination or expiration of this SLA, maintaining their ongoing enforceability. This duration clause is intended to promote stability and clarity in the service relationship while allowing flexibility for adjustments aligned with the Parties’ strategic interests.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>Either party may terminate this SLA in accordance with the provisions outlined herein, subject to the specified notice periods and conditions. Termination for convenience shall require that the terminating party provide written notice to the other at least sixty (60) days prior to the intended termination date. Such notice shall specify the effective date of termination and shall be delivered via authorized communication channels. In the event of termination for cause, the non-breaching party must furnish written notice of the breach, specifying the nature of the breach, and allow the breaching party a period of thirty (30) days to cure such breach. Failure to remedy the breach within this period shall constitute grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Termination shall also be permissible if either party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or ceases its business operations, provided that the affected party delivers prompt written notice to the other. Upon termination, the Provider shall cease all services within a reasonable timeframe and shall deliver to the Client all data, reports, and materials in its possession, subject to the Client’s payment of all outstanding fees up to the termination date. The Client shall, in turn, ensure the timely retrieval and secure handling of its data and intellectual property rights, which shall survive the termination of this SLA.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, the Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Service immediately if the Client fails to comply with usage policies, security obligations, or data provision requirements, or if continued engagement poses a risk to the security or integrity of the platform. All such terminations shall be documented, and the Parties shall cooperate to facilitate an orderly transition, including the proper transfer or deletion of data, in accordance with applicable laws and contractual obligations.</p>

<h2>Amendments and Modifications</h2>
<p>Any amendments or modifications to this SLA shall be made in writing and executed by duly authorized representatives of both parties. Such amendments shall specify the scope of changes, effective date, and any adjustments to the obligations, service levels, or fees associated with the Service. No verbal agreement or oral communication shall be deemed to constitute an amendment to this Agreement unless subsequently confirmed in writing.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to review the terms of this SLA periodically, and any proposed modifications shall be subject to mutual consent and documented as an addendum or revised schedule. Such review may be initiated by either party upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice, specifying the areas of concern or intended changes. The Provider shall provide sufficient detail and rationale for proposed amendments to facilitate informed decision-making by the Client.</p>
<p>Any amendments that materially affect the scope, performance standards, or support commitments shall require the express written approval of authorized representatives of both parties. Upon execution, the amendments shall become an integral part of this SLA and shall be binding upon the parties for the duration of the Agreement or until further amended.</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to the amendment process may be deemed a breach of this SLA. In such cases, the unaltered provisions of the original agreement shall remain in effect until a formal amendment is executed. This clause ensures that all modifications are transparent, deliberate, and mutually agreed, thereby maintaining the integrity and clarity of the contractual relationship.</p>

<h3>Procedure for Changes</h3>
<p>Any modifications, updates, or amendments to this SLA, including scope adjustments, performance standards, or support obligations, shall follow a formal change management process to ensure clarity, mutual agreement, and proper documentation. The party initiating the change (the "Requesting Party") shall submit a written Change Request to the other party, clearly describing the nature of the proposed change, the rationale, and the anticipated impact on service delivery, performance, and costs.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving party shall review the proposed modifications and evaluate their implications, including technical feasibility, resource requirements, and compliance considerations. Both parties shall collaborate in good faith to negotiate the terms of the change, seeking to reach a mutual agreement within a reasonable timeframe, typically not exceeding fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request.</p>
<p>Once an agreement is reached, the change shall be documented in an addendum or revised schedule, signed by authorized representatives of both parties. This documentation shall specify the scope of the change, effective date, any adjustments to fees or service levels, and a plan for implementation. Changes shall not be deemed effective until duly executed and incorporated into this SLA.</p>
<p>In the absence of mutual agreement, the parties shall continue to operate under the existing terms. Any disagreements regarding proposed changes shall be resolved through escalation procedures outlined elsewhere within this SLA or, if necessary, through dispute resolution mechanisms as specified in the overarching contractual agreement.</p>
<p>This structured process ensures that all modifications are managed systematically, minimizing disruptions, maintaining service integrity, and preserving the contractual relationship's transparency and enforceability.</p>

<h3>Notification Requirements</h3>
<p>Both parties shall adhere to the notification procedures set forth in this section to ensure timely communication of pertinent information related to the Service, incidents, or contractual matters. All notices, requests, or other communications under this SLA shall be in writing and delivered via email, registered mail, or other mutually agreed electronic means to the designated contacts specified in the contact details section of this Agreement.</p>
<p>In the event of a material incident, breach, or security concern that could impact the Service or data integrity, the notifying party shall provide a detailed written notice within one (1) business day of becoming aware of the issue. Such notice shall include a description of the nature of the concern, affected systems or data, and any immediate remedial actions undertaken or recommended. The receiving party shall acknowledge receipt of such notification promptly and shall cooperate fully to address the matter.</p>
<p>For routine updates, scheduled maintenance, or non-urgent communications, the Provider shall notify the Client at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance, unless unforeseen circumstances necessitate expedited notices. The Client shall likewise notify the Provider of any changes to contact information or personnel authorized to receive such notices to prevent delays or miscommunications.</p>
<p>Any failure to comply with these notification requirements may result in delayed response times or inadequate incident management, which could adversely affect the performance and security of the Service. Both parties shall maintain records of all notifications exchanged under this SLA for audit and compliance purposes. It is acknowledged that inconsistent terminology may cause ambiguity regarding the notification channels, and as such, clarity in the designated contacts and methods is essential to ensure effective communication throughout the term of this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the applicable contractual documentation, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Both parties agree that any disputes arising out of or relating to this SLA, including its interpretation, performance, or breach, shall be resolved through good-faith negotiations initially. Should negotiations fail to resolve the matter within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the designated arbitration body, with the location specified within the contractual documentation.</p>
<p>In cases where arbitration is not stipulated or applicable, the parties agree that the courts of the specified jurisdiction shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any legal proceedings related to this Agreement. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objections based on venue or forum non conveniens. The prevailing party in any legal action or arbitration shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred.</p>
<p>This clause aims to provide a fair, efficient, and enforceable mechanism for resolving disputes, minimizing disruptions to the Service, and protecting the interests of both parties. Both parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve issues amicably before initiating formal proceedings, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and mutual respect in maintaining the business relationship.</p>

<h3>Applicable Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the parties agree that the applicable jurisdiction governing this SLA and any disputes arising therefrom shall be the courts located within the jurisdiction specified in the contractual documentation or as mutually designated in writing by both parties. In the absence of such specification, the jurisdiction shall be deemed to be the courts of the jurisdiction where the Provider’s principal place of business is located. This choice of jurisdiction shall apply to all legal proceedings, including but not limited to enforcement, interpretation, and dispute resolution related to this Agreement.</p>
<p>Both parties acknowledge the importance of clarity regarding jurisdiction to facilitate effective legal recourse and to ensure that any legal actions are conducted in a manner consistent with applicable laws and procedural norms. The parties also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the designated courts and waive any objections based on venue, jurisdictional forum non conveniens, or other jurisdictional challenges, provided such courts are competent and have proper venue.</p>
<p>This provision is intended to provide certainty and stability in the resolution of legal matters related to this SLA, thereby promoting a predictable and efficient dispute resolution process. The parties further agree that this choice of jurisdiction shall be binding and shall supersede any conflicting provisions in other agreements or prior communications, unless expressly amended in a subsequent written document signed by authorized representatives of both parties.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this SLA, including its validity, interpretation, breach, or termination, the parties agree to submit the matter exclusively to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the designated arbitration body specified in the governing law section. The arbitration shall be conducted in the jurisdiction specified in this Agreement, and the proceedings shall be administered by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the applicable rules.</p>
<p>The arbitration process shall be conducted in the English language and in a manner that ensures a fair and impartial resolution. The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the scope of the dispute and to award any remedies or damages permissible under applicable law, including, but not limited to, specific performance, injunctive relief, or damages. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration, unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties, with no right to appeal, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that arbitration shall be the sole remedy for disputes arising under this SLA, and they waive their rights to pursue litigation or other dispute resolution procedures in courts, except for the enforcement of arbitration awards. This arbitration clause is intended to promote efficient resolution, preserve confidentiality, and minimize disruption to the ongoing relationship between the Provider and the Client.</p>
