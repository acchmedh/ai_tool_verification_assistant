<h3>Obligations of Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Each party agrees to uphold the confidentiality of all Confidential Information received in connection with these Terms of Service and shall employ at least the same degree of care to protect such information as it uses for its own comparable data, but in no event less than reasonable care. The recipient shall not disclose, distribute, or disseminate Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, except to those employees, affiliates, or agents who require access for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations under these Terms and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those herein.</p>
<p>The recipient shall only use Confidential Information for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under these Terms. Any permitted disclosures shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary and only to those individuals or entities who are bound by confidentiality obligations. The recipient shall ensure that all such individuals understand and comply with these confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach or threatened breach of confidentiality, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, damages, or any other appropriate remedy to prevent further unauthorized disclosures or use. Upon termination or expiration of these Terms, or upon written request of the disclosing party, the recipient shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information, including copies, summaries, or derivations thereof, and certify to such destruction or return in writing. These obligations shall survive for a period of five (5) years following termination, unless a longer period is required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>Liability and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the licensor shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your use or inability to use InsightAI Nexus, even if the licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, but is not limited to, damages resulting from data inaccuracies, loss of data, interruptions in service, or unauthorized access to your data or account.</p>
<p>The platform is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. The licensor expressly disclaims any warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the data, reports, or insights generated through the platform. Additionally, the licensor does not warrant that the platform will meet your specific requirements or that its operation will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>
<p>In no event shall the licensor be liable for any damages exceeding the fees paid by the organization for the use of InsightAI Nexus during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or for any damages that result from misuse, unauthorized modifications, or breach of these terms by the user. The user acknowledges that the use of the platform involves inherent risks, and the licensor shall not be responsible for any unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security incidents, notwithstanding the implementation of security measures.</p>
<p>These limitations of liability shall survive termination of these Terms and shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law. The user agrees that this disclaimer of liability is an essential basis of the bargain and that the licensor would not provide the platform without such limitations. Therefore, users should implement appropriate backup, security, and risk mitigation measures independently to protect their data and operations.</p>

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>In no event shall the licensor, its affiliates, or its licensors be liable for any damages, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, arising out of or relating to the use, inability to use, or performance of InsightAI Nexus, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. The total aggregate liability of the licensor under or in connection with these Terms shall not exceed the fees paid by the organization for the platform during the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the event giving rise to such liability. This limitation applies regardless of the cause of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Such limitations are an essential basis of the bargain between the parties and apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The licensor shall not be responsible for any damages resulting from (i) data inaccuracies or incomplete data inputs, (ii) interruptions or delays in service, (iii) unauthorized access or security breaches, or (iv) reliance on reports, insights, or recommendations generated by the platform. Users acknowledge and agree that the use of InsightAI Nexus involves risks inherent to data analytics and AI-driven systems, and the licensor disclaims any warranty or liability for damages arising from such risks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the licensor shall not be liable for any damages resulting from actions taken or omitted based on the information provided through the platform, including decisions made by users or third parties. The organization shall bear sole responsibility for implementing appropriate safeguards, data validation, and operational controls. These limitations of liability shall survive termination or expiration of these Terms and shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

<h3>Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
<p>INSIGHTAI NEXUS AND ALL RELATED SERVICES AND MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" AND "AS-AVAILABLE" BASIS.

THE LICENSOR DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY DATA, INSIGHTS, OR REPORTS GENERATED USING THE PLATFORM.</p>
<p>THE LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES THAT THE PLATFORM WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. FURTHER, THE LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM WILL BE CONTINUOUS, SECURE, OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. USERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE USE OF THE PLATFORM INVOLVES INHERENT RISKS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DATA LOSS OR SECURITY BREACHES, AND ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS.</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE PLATFORM AND ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OR SERVICES LINKED THERETO. THE ORGANIZATION IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THE RESULTS OBTAINED THROUGH THE PLATFORM AND SHALL BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USE. THIS DISCLAIMER SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<h2>Termination of Agreement</h2>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing written notice to the other party, with or without cause, subject to the provisions outlined herein. Termination shall become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, unless a shorter period is specified in the notice or required by applicable law. In the event of termination, all rights granted under these Terms shall cease immediately, and the organization shall promptly discontinue all use of InsightAI Nexus.</p>
<p>Upon termination, the organization shall certify in writing that all copies of the platform, related materials, and any proprietary data have been destroyed or returned to the licensor, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Termination shall not relieve the organization from any obligations incurred prior to the effective date, including payment obligations, confidentiality commitments, and data security responsibilities.</p>
<p>The licensor reserves the right to suspend or revoke access immediately if it determines, at its sole discretion, that the organization has materially breached these Terms, engaged in unauthorized use, or posed a security or legal risk. In such cases, the licensor shall notify the organization of the suspension or termination, and the organization shall have no claim against the licensor for any damages or losses resulting from such actions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the licensor may terminate this Agreement without prior notice if required by legal, regulatory, or governmental authorities. In the event of such termination, the organization shall comply with all instructions regarding data retention, destruction, or transfer issued by the licensor or applicable authorities. The provisions of confidentiality, liability, and intellectual property rights shall survive termination to the extent necessary to enforce such obligations or to address ongoing legal rights or responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>Termination of this Agreement shall occur under the following conditions: either party may initiate termination in accordance with the notice provisions specified herein, including but not limited to breach of contractual obligations, violation of applicable laws, or circumstances that materially impair the continued use or support of InsightAI Nexus. Such termination shall require written notice delivered to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date, unless immediate termination is justified due to a material breach that remains unremedied after a specified cure period.</p>
<p>In cases where the organization fails to comply with these Terms or applicable legal requirements, the licensor reserves the right to suspend or terminate access immediately upon written notice. Termination may also be enacted if the licensor determines that continued use poses a security risk, violates intellectual property rights, or contravenes organizational policies. Additionally, the licensor may terminate this Agreement without cause, provided that a thirty (30) day prior written notice is given to the organization.</p>
<p>Upon termination, the organization shall promptly cease all use of InsightAI Nexus and certify in writing that all copies of the software, documentation, and proprietary data have been destroyed or returned, unless otherwise specified in the termination notice. The organization shall remain liable for any outstanding payments or obligations incurred prior to the effective date of termination. Furthermore, the confidentiality, data security, and intellectual property provisions shall survive such termination to ensure ongoing protection of proprietary rights and sensitive information.</p>
<p>Termination shall not prejudice any rights or remedies available to either party under law or these Terms. In the event of dispute regarding termination, the parties shall seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures outlined herein, and all unresolved matters shall be subject to the jurisdiction specified in the governing law clause. The licensor’s decision to terminate shall be final and binding, without prejudice to any other rights or claims the licensor may have against the organization for breach or misconduct.</p>

<h3>Post-Termination Obligations</h3>
<p>Following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the organization shall promptly cease all use of InsightAI Nexus and shall, within thirty (30) days of such termination, destroy or return to the licensor all copies of the platform, related documentation, and any proprietary data or Confidential Information in its possession or control, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The organization shall provide written certification to the licensor confirming compliance with these obligations upon request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the organization may retain copies of data or reports generated through the platform solely for archival purposes, provided that such retained data remains subject to confidentiality and data security obligations outlined herein.</p>
<p>Any ongoing confidentiality or data security obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect for the period specified in these Terms or as mandated by applicable law. The organization shall also ensure that any residual Confidential Information or data stored on its systems is securely deleted or rendered inaccessible, consistent with industry best practices. Additionally, the organization shall cooperate with the licensor in any post-termination audits or investigations necessary to verify compliance with these obligations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the organization shall not use or disclose any intellectual property rights or Confidential Information of the licensor beyond the scope permitted during the term of the Agreement. Any licenses or rights granted shall automatically terminate, and the organization shall cease all further use or distribution of any proprietary materials. Failure to adhere to these post-termination obligations may result in legal action, including claims for damages or injunctive relief, to protect the licensor’s rights and interests.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the licensing agreement, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, including but not limited to their formation, validity, interpretation, or breach, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules established by an arbitration organization mutually agreed upon by the parties at the time of dispute. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitration organization within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts located within the jurisdiction specified in the licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Prior to initiating arbitration, the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute amicably through good-faith negotiations. If such negotiations are unsuccessful within forty-five (45) days of written notice of dispute, arbitration shall proceed. The arbitration shall be conducted in the language specified in the licensing agreement, and the decision rendered shall be final and binding on both parties, with limited rights of appeal under applicable law. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses associated with the arbitration, unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in the courts of competent jurisdiction to protect its rights, intellectual property, or Confidential Information. Any such action shall be filed in the courts located within the jurisdiction specified in the licensing agreement. These provisions do not preclude either party from seeking interim or provisional relief necessary to prevent irreparable harm before arbitration or litigation proceedings commence. By agreeing to these Terms, the user and organization consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue specified herein for all disputes not subject to arbitration.</p>

<h3>Applicable Law</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the licensing agreement or service order, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The parties agree that any legal actions, proceedings, or disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located within the designated jurisdiction, unless otherwise stipulated herein or agreed upon in writing by both parties.</p>
<p>In the event of any inconsistency between the governing law clause and other provisions of these Terms, the governing law shall prevail to the extent necessary to resolve such inconsistency. The parties acknowledge that this choice of law is a fundamental element of their agreement, and it reflects the reasonable expectations of both parties regarding the legal framework applicable to their relationship and the interpretation of these Terms.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall limit the right of either party to seek interim or injunctive relief in the courts of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights, Confidential Information, or other proprietary interests. Additionally, if applicable, specific provisions relating to dispute resolution, arbitration, or jurisdictional matters outlined elsewhere in these Terms shall take precedence over this general governing law clause. The parties agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the chosen jurisdiction in their use and management of InsightAI Nexus.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Clause</h3>
<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, including the formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity thereof, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of an arbitration organization mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days of the dispute being raised, the arbitration shall be administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Arbitration Rules or equivalent, as determined by the parties.</p>
<p>The arbitration proceedings shall be held in the jurisdiction specified in the governing law section, and the language of arbitration shall be English unless otherwise agreed. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the arbitration, with the arbitration tribunal having the authority to apportion costs and fees as deemed appropriate. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights, Confidential Information, or to prevent irreparable harm. The arbitration provisions herein shall not preclude the parties from seeking interim relief or other provisional remedies necessary to preserve their rights prior to or during arbitration. By agreeing to these Terms, both parties waive their right to pursue any claims in a court of law or through class actions, and agree that arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for resolving disputes under these Terms of Service.</p>
