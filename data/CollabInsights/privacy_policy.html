<h3>Types of Information Collected</h3>
<p>CollabInsights collects various types of information to support its platform functionalities and to ensure compliance with applicable legal standards. These include personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, and organizational details provided during registration or profile updates. Additionally, the platform gathers user-generated content, including insights, visualizations, comments, and collaborative contributions, which are essential for facilitating effective teamwork and data sharing.</p>

Users are encouraged to review our cookie and privacy notices for detailed information regarding the scope and nature of data collection.</p>

<h3>Methods of Information Collection</h3>
<p>CollabInsights employs a variety of methods to collect information from its users and their interactions with the platform, ensuring that data is gathered in a manner that is transparent and compliant with applicable legal standards. These methods include both active and passive collection techniques designed to optimize user experience while maintaining data security.</p>
<p>Active collection occurs when users directly provide information through registration forms, profile updates, or during the use of specific platform features. This includes inputting personal details such as names, email addresses, and organizational affiliations, as well as creating and sharing insights, visualizations, and comments. Users may also voluntarily submit feedback or participate in surveys to help improve platform service offerings.</p>
<p>Passive data collection relies on automated technologies such as cookies, web beacons, log files, and tracking scripts embedded within the platform. These technologies enable CollabInsights to monitor user activity, device information, browser types, and IP addresses, facilitating performance analysis and security monitoring. For example, cookies help retain user preferences, authenticate sessions, and gather analytics on platform usage patterns.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our platform integrates with external systems via APIs, which may transmit data passively during data exchanges. This method ensures seamless interoperability with third-party services and enhances data sharing capabilities within collaborative environments. All passive collection practices are conducted in accordance with our cookie and privacy policies, and users are provided with options to manage or withdraw consent where applicable.</p>
<p>By employing these comprehensive methods, CollabInsights aims to ensure that all data collection processes are conducted responsibly, securely, and with full transparency to our users, thereby supporting our commitment to privacy and data protection standards.</p>

Our security protocols are designed to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of personal and organizational information processed through our platform.</p>
<p>We employ industry-standard encryption methods for data in transit and at rest, including TLS protocols for data transmitted over networks and encryption algorithms to protect stored data. Access controls are enforced through role-based permissions, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information based on their responsibilities. Additionally, we utilize secure authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to enhance account security.</p>
<p>Regular security assessments, vulnerability scans, and audits are conducted to identify and address potential risks. We also maintain detailed incident response procedures to detect, respond to, and mitigate any security breaches promptly. Our staff undergo ongoing security training to ensure awareness of best practices and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>Despite these precautions, no system can be entirely invulnerable. Therefore, we continuously review and update our security policies to adapt to emerging threats and technological advancements.

<p>It is important to note that data which is processed for compliance with legal obligations or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims may be exempt from data portability rights. Additionally, data shared with third-party service providers under contractual agreements may not be directly accessible for transfer, and users are encouraged to review any specific limitations outlined in our data sharing disclosures.</p>
<p>We are committed to facilitating data portability requests efficiently and securely, ensuring that users can exercise their rights without undue burden while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of their data during the transfer process. Users are encouraged to review their account settings and data sharing preferences to understand the scope of data available for portability and to ensure their information is accurate and complete prior to making a request.</p>
