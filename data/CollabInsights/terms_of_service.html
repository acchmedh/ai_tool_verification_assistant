We reserve the right to retain, delete, or anonymize your data in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable laws.</p>
<p>This section does not limit any other rights or remedies available to us under law or equity, and termination for any reason will not release you from obligations that accrued prior to termination, including payment obligations and indemnification provisions.</p>

<h3>Effect of Termination</h3>
<p>Upon the termination or suspension of your access to the CollabInsights platform, all rights granted to you under this Agreement shall immediately cease, and you shall discontinue all use of the platform and any related services. Termination does not automatically entitle you to any refund of fees paid, unless otherwise specified in the applicable agreement or subscription plan. You remain responsible for any outstanding payments or obligations incurred prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
<p>Following termination, [Company Name] reserves the right to delete or anonymize your data and content stored on our servers in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable legal requirements. We shall not be liable for any loss of data or content resulting from such actions or from your failure to retain copies prior to termination. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you have secured any necessary backups or copies of your data before termination occurs.</p>
<p>Termination of your access shall not affect any provisions of this Agreement that expressly or by implication are intended to survive, including but not limited to confidentiality, intellectual property rights, indemnification, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution clauses. You agree that we shall not be liable for any damages or losses arising out of or related to the termination or suspension of your account or access to the platform.</p>
<p>In the event of termination, you shall promptly cease all use of the platform and delete any copies of the platform’s software or content in your possession, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Any provisions of this Agreement that by their nature are intended to survive termination shall continue to apply, including those related to ownership rights, confidentiality, and dispute resolution. The termination of this Agreement shall not prejudice or limit any rights or remedies available to either party under applicable law.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its formation, validity, interpretation, or breach, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration administered by [Arbitration Institution] in [Location]. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, and the arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on both parties. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any breach of confidentiality, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights. In such cases, you agree that the courts located within [Jurisdiction] shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any legal proceedings that cannot be resolved through arbitration. The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections based on venue or inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>Any claim or dispute must be initiated within one (1) year after the cause of action arises; otherwise, such claim shall be barred. This section shall survive termination of this Agreement and remains in effect for all disputes that may arise from your use of the platform or related services. If any provision of this section is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>Applicable Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service, including all disputes and interpretations arising therefrom, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding related to this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively within the courts located in [Jurisdiction], and each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. The parties agree that the choice of jurisdiction is fair and reasonable, given the location of the principal offices of [Company Name] and the primary place of business.</p>
<p>In the event of any inconsistency between the laws of [Jurisdiction] and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this jurisdiction shall prevail, unless otherwise specified herein. Users expressly agree to waive any objections to the jurisdiction or venue of such courts and agree that service of process may be effected by any lawful means. This jurisdiction clause applies to all claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to your use of the platform, including claims for breach of contract, tort, or statutory violations.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that this choice of jurisdiction is a fundamental aspect of the agreement, and both parties agree to resolve disputes within this jurisdiction to promote efficiency and legal certainty. This provision shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect for all disputes that may subsequently arise. Nothing in this section limits the right of [Company Name] to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its formation, validity, interpretation, breach, or termination, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of [Arbitration Institution]. The arbitration shall be conducted in [Location], in the English language, and the arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the institution’s procedures. The arbitration panel shall consist of a single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise. The arbitration process shall be confidential, and the arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on both parties, with limited rights of appeal under applicable law.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the arbitration, including legal fees, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise based on the circumstances of the dispute. The arbitration award shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or address violations of confidentiality, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights, without waiving the obligation to arbitrate disputes under this section.</p>
<p>To initiate arbitration, the initiating party must provide written notice to the other party specifying the nature of the dispute and the relief sought. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to select an arbitrator and schedule the arbitration proceedings promptly. This arbitration clause shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall apply to any disputes that arise during or after the termination of your use of the platform. By agreeing to this process, you waive your right to pursue claims in court or through class action proceedings, except as provided by applicable law.</p>
