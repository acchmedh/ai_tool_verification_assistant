<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to Tool_1 (“Service”), an AI Analytics platform designed to provide actionable insights and predictive
    analysis specifically aimed at product managers. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
    Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree to these Terms, please
    do not use the Service.</p>
<p>The Service is intended to assist product managers in optimizing product development and enhancing user experience.
    Throughout this document, the term “User” and “Customer” may be used interchangeably to refer to individuals or
    entities who register for or utilize the Service, which might cause some ambiguity regarding the exact roles and
    responsibilities of each party.</p>
<p>These Terms govern your use of Tool_1, including any updates, features, or enhancements that may be added in the
    future. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, with or without prior notice, and continued use of
    the Service following any such changes will constitute your acceptance of the new terms. For the avoidance of doubt,
    the Service is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, unless explicitly stated otherwise in a separate
    agreement.</p>
<p>Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service. If you have any questions, contact our support team for
    clarification. Note that the timeframe for dispute resolution or termination notice periods are referenced as
    “reasonable periods” without further definition, which might lead to differing interpretations.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms and conditions under which the Service is provided to
    the User. Tool_1 aims to deliver advanced AI-driven analytics, enabling product managers to gain actionable insights
    and predictive analysis that support informed decision-making in product development cycles. This Agreement outlines
    the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of both the Service provider and the Customer to ensure a clear
    understanding of the scope and limitations of the Service.</p>
<p>By entering into this Agreement, the User acknowledges that the Service is designed to complement, not replace,
    existing business processes and decisions. The Service provider commits to maintaining the availability and
    performance of Tool_1 consistent with industry standards; however, the User accepts that certain disruptions or
    inaccuracies may occur, given the inherent nature of predictive analytics technology.</p>
<p>It is expressly stated that while the Service provider will endeavor to protect User data and privacy, certain data
    retention policies may vary. For instance, in some sections, the Agreement mentions that data will be deleted upon
    termination of the Customer account, whereas other clauses imply retention for a reasonable period post-termination,
    leading to potential inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement without strict
    delineation, which may affect the interpretation of respective rights and liabilities. Users are advised to
    carefully review this Agreement in its entirety to understand the full extent of the Service’s offerings and
    limitations.</p>

<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>By accessing or using Tool_1, the Customer agrees to be bound by these Terms of Service. The act of registering for
    the Service, accessing any part of the platform, or using any features constitutes acceptance of this Agreement in
    full. If the User does not agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth herein, they must immediately cease
    use of the Service.</p>
<p>The acceptance is considered effective as of the date the User first accesses the Service or agrees to the Terms,
    whichever occurs earlier. Customers acknowledge and agree that their continued use of the Service after any updates
    or modifications to these Terms will constitute acceptance of those changes, regardless of whether the User has been
    explicitly notified.</p>
<p>It is important to note that acceptance of these Terms does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free access to the
    Service, as Tool_1 is provided “as is” and without warranties beyond those stated in separate agreements, if any.
    The Service provider retains the right to suspend or terminate access to the platform for any User who violates
    these Terms, though no specific timeframe for such actions is provided, which may lead to uncertainty as to when
    enforcement measures are applied.</p>
<p>Additionally, Users should be aware that certain obligations or rights may differ depending on whether the party is
    referred to as a “Customer” or “User” in various sections of this Agreement, even though these terms are often used
    interchangeably. This lack of precise terminology may affect the interpretation of responsibilities and privileges
    under this Agreement. Therefore, it is recommended that each party carefully review the entire Agreement to
    understand their rights and obligations comprehensively.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below. These definitions
    are intended to provide clarity, although certain terms may be subject to varying interpretations depending on
    context within this Agreement.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>“Service”</strong> refers to Tool_1, the AI Analytics platform designed to provide actionable insights
        and predictive analysis for product managers, including all related software, features, updates, and
        enhancements made available by the Service provider.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“User”</strong> means any individual or entity that accesses or utilizes the Service, whether by
        registration or otherwise. Note that in some instances, “User” is used interchangeably with “Customer,” though
        such usage may not always be consistent throughout this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Customer”</strong> generally denotes the party who has entered into a contractual relationship with the
        Service provider for use of the Service, and may imply additional rights or responsibilities not explicitly
        assigned to the term “User.” The distinction between “User” and “Customer” is not always clearly defined within
        this Agreement, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding each party’s exact status.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Data”</strong> refers to any information, including but not limited to analytics results, raw input,
        and user-generated content, collected, processed, or stored by the Service in connection with the User’s use of
        Tool_1.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Termination”</strong> means the cessation of access to the Service by the User or Customer, whether
        initiated by the Service provider or the User. The specific conditions and timing for Termination, including
        data retention or deletion post-Termination, are subject to differing interpretations within this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Reasonable Period”</strong> is used throughout this Agreement to describe certain timeframes for
        notices, dispute resolutions, and data retention. However, this term is not explicitly defined, which may lead
        to varying expectations or interpretations between the parties.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The foregoing definitions are intended as a guide; any ambiguity arising from their use should be interpreted in
    light of the full Agreement and the context in which the terms appear.</p>

<h2>Scope of Services</h2>
<p>The Service provider commits to delivering the core functionalities of Tool_1 as described in this Agreement,
    including but not limited to the provision of AI-driven analytics, predictive modeling, and actionable insights
    tailored primarily for product managers. These services encompass data collection, processing, and presentation of
    analytics results through the platform’s user interface and API integrations where applicable.</p>
<p>Tool_1 is intended to assist Users in making informed product development decisions by providing timely and relevant
    data insights. However, the Service provider does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the
    data presented, nor does it warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. Users acknowledge that
    predictive analytics inherently involve probabilistic outcomes, and as such, the Service should be considered a
    supplementary tool rather than a definitive solution.</p>
<p>The scope of Services further includes periodic updates, feature enhancements, and maintenance activities undertaken
    by the Service provider. Such updates may be implemented automatically without prior notice, and Users are
    responsible for ensuring their systems remain compatible with the evolving platform. While the Service provider
    endeavors to minimize disruptions, temporary service outages or degraded performance may occur during maintenance
    windows or unexpected events.</p>
<p>Notably, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used without clear differentiation within this section, which may affect
    the understanding of which parties are entitled to specific features or support levels. Additionally, data retention
    practices related to analytics outputs and User content are described inconsistently in different parts of this
    Agreement; some clauses indicate immediate deletion upon account termination, whereas others suggest retention for
    an unspecified reasonable period. These inconsistencies should be considered when evaluating the Service’s
    operational boundaries.</p>

<h3>Description of Services</h3>
<p>Tool_1 offers a suite of AI-powered analytics capabilities designed to enable product managers to derive actionable
    insights and predictive forecasts from their product data. The Service includes data ingestion, automated analysis,
    and visualization tools accessible via a web-based dashboard and API endpoints. These features collectively aim to
    enhance decision-making processes by highlighting trends, user behaviors, and potential future outcomes based on
    historical and real-time data inputs.</p>
<p>The Service provider commits to delivering these functionalities in a manner consistent with reasonable industry
    practices. However, Users should be aware that the predictive models utilized by the Service are subject to inherent
    limitations and may not always yield precise or fully reliable results. Furthermore, the Service provider does not
    warrant that all features will be continuously available or free from errors, and Users accept that occasional
    interruptions or inaccuracies may occur without prior notice.</p>
<p>While the Service facilitates integration with various third-party platforms, compatibility is not guaranteed across
    all systems. It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure their infrastructure supports such integrations.
    Notably, the terms “Customer” and “User” remain interchangeable in this section, which may cause ambiguity
    concerning the scope of access and support provided.</p>
<p>Regarding data management, the Service is described in some clauses as deleting User Data immediately upon account
    termination, while elsewhere it indicates that Data may be retained for an unspecified reasonable period to comply
    with legal or operational requirements. This contradiction could lead to confusion about data handling
    post-Termination. Users are encouraged to review applicable privacy policies and contact support for clarification
    if needed.</p>

<h3>Service Availability and Limitations</h3>
<p>The Service provider strives to ensure that Tool_1 is available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, subject
    to scheduled maintenance, updates, or unforeseen technical issues. While the Service is designed for high
    availability, Users acknowledge and agree that occasional outages or degraded performance may occur without prior
    notice. The Service provider does not guarantee uninterrupted access, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage
    resulting from temporary inaccessibility of the Service.</p>
<p>Scheduled maintenance windows will generally be communicated in advance; however, emergency maintenance or urgent
    updates may be performed without notice to mitigate security risks or critical failures. The Customer is responsible
    for ensuring that their environment and systems are prepared for such interruptions.</p>
<p>Limitations of the Service include, but are not limited to, the inherent uncertainty in predictive analytics,
    potential data processing delays, and compatibility issues with third-party integrations. The Service provider
    disclaims any warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of analytics outputs. Users should use
    the insights provided by Tool_1 as a supplementary aid rather than sole grounds for decision-making.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably within this section,
    which may lead to confusion regarding the applicability of certain limitations or responsibilities. Additionally,
    while the Service provider endeavors to restore access promptly after outages, no specific timeframe for restoration
    is provided, creating ambiguity around response expectations.</p>
<p>Finally, in certain clauses, the Agreement suggests that the Service may be suspended or restricted at the provider’s
    discretion “without prior notice,” but elsewhere it implies that Users will receive notice within a reasonable
    period before suspension. This inconsistency may affect Users’ understanding of their rights in relation to Service
    availability and enforcement actions.</p>

<h3>Modifications to Services</h3>
<p>The Service provider reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of Tool_1 at any time,
    including but not limited to features, functionalities, user interface elements, and underlying algorithms. Such
    modifications may be implemented to improve performance, comply with legal requirements, or adapt to evolving
    technological standards. The Customer and Users acknowledge that these changes may occur without prior notice or
    with notice provided within what the Service provider deems a reasonable period, a term which remains undefined and
    subject to interpretation.</p>
<p>While the Service provider aims to minimize disruptions caused by modifications, temporary interruptions or
    alterations in Service availability may result. The Service provider shall not be liable for any adverse effects
    arising from such changes, including loss of data, changes in analytics outputs, or incompatibility with previously
    supported third-party integrations.</p>
<p>In certain instances, the Service provider may introduce new features or remove existing functionalities based on
    usage patterns, technical feasibility, or strategic business decisions. Both “User” and “Customer” may be affected
    differently by such changes, though this Agreement does not distinctly clarify how modifications apply to each
    party, potentially causing confusion regarding entitlements and obligations post-modification.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Agreement inconsistently references the notification protocol for modifications; some clauses suggest
    that Users will be informed in advance, while others imply that modifications can take effect immediately without
    any prior communication. This contradiction may lead to uncertainty about the timing and scope of changes.</p>
<p>Users are encouraged to regularly review the Terms and any update communications to stay informed about
    modifications. Continued use of the Service following any such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms
    and the modified Service, regardless of whether explicit consent was obtained.</p>

<h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>As a User or Customer of Tool_1, you acknowledge and agree to adhere to all applicable obligations set forth in this
    Agreement and any additional guidelines provided by the Service provider. Users are responsible for maintaining the
    confidentiality of their account credentials and for all activities that occur under their account, whether
    authorized or unauthorized. It is incumbent upon the Customer to ensure that their use of the Service complies with
    all relevant laws and regulations, including data protection and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Users must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information during registration and throughout their use of the
    Service. The Service provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts if any information is found to be
    false, misleading, or incomplete. Additionally, both Users and Customers are prohibited from attempting to reverse
    engineer, disrupt, or otherwise misuse any part of Tool_1, including its underlying algorithms, APIs, or data
    streams.</p>
<p>The User is responsible for regularly reviewing and backing up any data or analytics outputs obtained through the
    Service, as the Service provider does not guarantee preservation of data beyond the Termination of the account.
    Notably, while some clauses indicate immediate deletion of User Data upon Termination, others suggest retention for
    a reasonable period to satisfy legal or operational requirements, which may affect Users’ expectations regarding
    data availability post-Termination.</p>
<p>Users are also expected to promptly report any security breaches, unauthorized access, or suspicious activities
    related to their accounts. Failure to comply with these responsibilities may result in suspension or termination of
    access without prior notice. The Agreement inconsistently uses the terms “User” and “Customer” within this section,
    sometimes implying different scopes of responsibility without clear differentiation, which could lead to ambiguity
    in enforcement or compliance expectations.</p>

<h3>Account Creation and Maintenance</h3>
<p>To access and utilize Tool_1, Users or Customers must create an account by providing accurate and complete
    registration information as requested during the sign-up process. It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure
    that all information submitted is truthful and up-to-date. The Service provider reserves the right to verify,
    modify, or reject any registration at its sole discretion. Failure to maintain accurate information may result in
    suspension or termination of the account without prior notice.</p>
<p>Upon successful registration, the User will receive credentials to access the Service. These credentials are
    confidential and must not be shared with unauthorized parties. The Customer is solely responsible for all activities
    conducted under their account, including those by any authorized or unauthorized individuals. The Service provider
    disclaims any liability arising from unauthorized use resulting from User negligence in safeguarding login
    details.</p>
<p>Account maintenance includes the obligation to promptly update any changes to registration information, such as
    contact details or billing information. While the Service provider endeavors to maintain account data securely,
    Users acknowledge that the Service may retain certain account information even after account Termination. This
    retention period is described inconsistently in various sections of this Agreement, with some clauses indicating
    immediate deletion of account data and others stating retention for a reasonable period, which is not clearly
    defined.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service provider may suspend or deactivate accounts that remain inactive for extended periods,
    though the exact duration constituting inactivity is not specified, potentially leading to ambiguity. Customers
    should regularly access their accounts to avoid unintended suspension. In the event of account suspension or
    termination, the User’s access will be restricted, but data retention policies as mentioned above will apply. Users
    are encouraged to contact support for clarification regarding account status or data management.</p>

<h3>Compliance with Applicable Laws</h3>
<p>Both the Service provider and the User agree to comply with all applicable local, national, and international laws,
    regulations, and standards relevant to the use and provision of Tool_1. This includes, but is not limited to, data
    protection laws, intellectual property rights, export control regulations, and any other legal obligations that may
    govern the collection, processing, storage, and transmission of Data through the Service.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges responsibility for ensuring that their use of the Service does not violate any applicable
    laws, including those related to privacy, data security, and content restrictions. The Service provider reserves the
    right to suspend or terminate access to the Service for any User or Customer found to be in breach of such laws or
    who engages in unlawful activities using Tool_1, though the timing and notice period for such enforcement actions
    are not clearly specified and may vary at the sole discretion of the Service provider.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Users must ensure that any Data uploaded, transmitted, or processed through the Service complies with
    all relevant legal requirements. The Service provider disclaims liability for any illegal use of the Service by the
    User or Customer, including unauthorized use of third-party intellectual property, prohibited content, or data that
    violates export control laws.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, while the terms “User” and “Customer” are often used interchangeably throughout this
    Agreement, in the context of legal compliance, certain obligations may apply differently to each party. This
    inconsistency in terminology may lead to uncertainty regarding which party bears specific legal responsibilities.
    Users and Customers are advised to consult legal counsel to clarify their obligations under this Agreement and
    applicable law.</p>

<h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
<p>Users and Customers agree to refrain from engaging in any activities that may harm, disrupt, or otherwise negatively
    impact the functionality, security, or integrity of Tool_1 or its associated systems. Prohibited activities include,
    but are not limited to, unauthorized access attempts, reverse engineering, distributing malicious code, or
    interfering with the normal operation of the Service. The User must not use the Service to transmit, store, or
    distribute any content that is unlawful, harmful, defamatory, infringing, or otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p>Additionally, Users and Customers are prohibited from attempting to bypass any security measures or access controls
    implemented within Tool_1. Any form of data scraping or extraction beyond that permitted by the Service’s interface
    or API is strictly forbidden. Attempts to overload or impair the Service’s performance through excessive requests or
    automated usage without prior authorization are also prohibited.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while this section refers to obligations applicable to both “Users” and “Customers,” the
    distinction between these terms remains unclear throughout this Agreement, which may cause uncertainty as to which
    party is subject to specific prohibitions. Furthermore, the Agreement inconsistently states that certain violations
    may result in immediate suspension, whereas other clauses suggest that such actions will only occur after a
    reasonable notice period, a timeframe which is undefined.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach of these prohibitions, the Service provider reserves the right to take any necessary
    actions, including suspension or termination of access, legal proceedings, or reporting to appropriate authorities.
    The User or Customer will be held responsible for any damages or losses arising from prohibited conduct, regardless
    of whether such conduct was intentional or accidental. Users are encouraged to consult this Agreement regularly to
    ensure compliance with all restrictions and obligations set forth herein.</p>

<h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
<p>Use of Tool_1 is subject to payment of fees as outlined in the applicable pricing plan selected by the User or
    Customer at the time of registration or subscription. All fees are stated in the relevant currency and exclude
    applicable taxes, which shall be the responsibility of the Customer unless otherwise specified. The Service provider
    reserves the right to modify fees or introduce new charges at any time, with changes becoming effective upon either
    immediate implementation or after a reasonable notice period, which is not explicitly defined within this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>Payments shall be made in accordance with the billing cycles and terms specified in the service order or subscription
    agreement. The Customer is responsible for providing valid payment information and ensuring timely payment of all
    invoices. Failure to remit payment by the due date may result in suspension or termination of Service access without
    prior notice. However, certain clauses in this Agreement suggest that Users may be afforded a grace period for late
    payments, though the length and conditions of such a period are not clearly articulated, potentially causing
    confusion.</p>
<p>Refunds or credits for any fees paid are not generally provided, except as required by applicable law or as expressly
    agreed in writing. The Service provider reserves the right to charge interest on overdue payments at a rate
    determined at its discretion. Additionally, the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably in
    this section, which may lead to ambiguity regarding which party holds the payment obligations, especially in
    scenarios involving multiple Users under a single Customer account.</p>

<h3>Subscription Fees</h3>
<p>Subscription fees for Tool_1 are payable in accordance with the selected subscription plan and the terms specified at
    the time of purchase or renewal. Fees are billed on a recurring basis, typically monthly or annually, depending on
    the subscription option chosen by the User or Customer. All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, duties, or
    levies, which shall be borne by the Customer unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>The Service provider reserves the right to adjust subscription fees at any time. Such adjustments may take effect
    immediately or following a reasonable notification period communicated to the User or Customer. However, the
    definition of “reasonable notification period” is not explicitly set forth in this Agreement, which may result in
    varying interpretations regarding the timing and adequacy of such notice.</p>
<p>Customers acknowledge and agree that subscription fees are non-refundable except where required by law or expressly
    stipulated in a separate written agreement. In some instances, the Agreement suggests that partial refunds may be
    available under certain circumstances, while other sections categorically deny any refund, creating a potential
    contradiction that Users should be aware of.</p>
<p>For accounts with multiple Users under a single Customer subscription, the responsibility for payment of subscription
    fees rests with the Customer. Nevertheless, certain provisions interchangeably refer to “User” obligations in the
    context of payment, which may cause ambiguity concerning liability for fees in multi-User scenarios.</p>
<p>Failure to pay subscription fees in a timely manner may result in suspension or termination of Service access. The
    timing and process for such enforcement actions are not consistently described across the Agreement, occasionally
    implying immediate suspension without notice and elsewhere referencing a grace period that lacks clear
    definition.</p>

<h3>Payment Terms</h3>
<p>Payments for the use of Tool_1 shall be made in accordance with the invoicing schedule and amounts set forth in the
    applicable subscription or service agreement. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that all payment details
    provided are accurate and kept up to date to avoid service interruptions. Payment methods accepted include credit
    cards, electronic funds transfers, and other options as specified by the Service provider. Fees due must be paid in
    full by the due date indicated on the invoice or billing statement.</p>
<p>In the event of a payment dispute, the User or Customer must notify the Service provider within a reasonable period
    to allow for resolution. However, the term "reasonable period" is not explicitly defined within this Agreement,
    which may lead to varying interpretations regarding the timeframe for dispute notification and resolution. Until
    such disputes are resolved, the Service provider reserves the right to suspend access to the Service if payments
    remain outstanding.</p>
<p>Late payments may incur interest charges calculated at a rate determined by the Service provider, which will be
    applied from the due date until full payment is received. While some clauses suggest that a grace period for late
    payments may be provided, this Agreement does not consistently articulate the existence or length of such a period,
    potentially causing confusion for Users and Customers alike.</p>
<p>It is important to note that throughout this Agreement, the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in
    the context of payment obligations. This inconsistent terminology may lead to uncertainty regarding which party is
    ultimately responsible for payment, especially if multiple Users operate under a single Customer account. The
    Service provider recommends that all parties clarify payment responsibilities prior to subscription to avoid
    disputes.</p>

<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<p>The Service provider aims to ensure Customer satisfaction with Tool_1; however, all subscription fees and payments
    are generally non-refundable. Refunds or credits will only be issued in exceptional circumstances and solely at the
    sole discretion of the Service provider. Any requests for refunds must be submitted in writing within a reasonable
    timeframe following the relevant transaction or billing event. Notably, the term “reasonable timeframe” is not
    explicitly defined herein, which may result in varying interpretations of eligibility for refunds.</p>
<p>In cases where a refund is granted, the amount refunded may be prorated based on the period of Service usage or the
    unused portion of the subscription term. Conversely, some clauses elsewhere in this Agreement suggest that no
    partial refunds are available under any circumstances, creating a potential contradiction regarding the treatment of
    refund requests. Customers and Users should carefully review all relevant provisions and contact Customer support
    for clarification.</p>
<p>Additionally, the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this section, which may lead to ambiguity
    about who is authorized to request refunds or who bears responsibility for payments. For example, if multiple Users
    operate under a single Customer account, it may be unclear which party’s request will be considered valid.</p>
<p>Refunds will not be issued for service interruptions, outages, or any dissatisfaction related to the accuracy or
    completeness of the analytics provided by Tool_1, as the Service is supplied “as is” without warranties beyond those
    set forth in separate agreements. Furthermore, any fees paid prior to suspension or termination of Service access
    for non-payment or breach of this Agreement are non-refundable.</p>
<p>Users and Customers are encouraged to contact the Service provider promptly regarding any billing concerns to
    facilitate timely resolution. The Service provider reserves the right to amend this Refund Policy at any time, with
    changes taking effect immediately upon posting on the Service platform or other communication channels.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All intellectual property rights in and to Tool_1, including but not limited to software code, algorithms, data
    models, documentation, trademarks, logos, and any enhancements or derivative works, are exclusively owned by the
    Service provider or its licensors. The User or Customer is granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive
    license to access and use the Service solely for their internal business purposes in accordance with this Agreement.
    No ownership rights or interests in the intellectual property are transferred or assigned to the User or Customer by
    virtue of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Users and Customers acknowledge that the Service provider retains all rights, title, and interest in any
    improvements, modifications, or customizations made to the Service, even if such changes are suggested or developed
    in connection with User feedback or collaborative efforts. Any unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, or
    reverse engineering of the Service or its components is strictly prohibited and may result in legal actions.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that any data, reports, or analytics generated through the use of Tool_1 remain the
    property of the User or Customer who provided the underlying data, except where otherwise agreed in writing.
    However, the Service provider may use aggregated and anonymized data for internal research or to improve the
    Service, provided that such use does not disclose any personally identifiable information or confidential business
    data.</p>
<p>Notably, the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably in this section without explicit
    clarification, which may lead to ambiguity concerning the ownership of generated content or data. Additionally,
    while this Agreement generally prohibits reverse engineering, one clause ambiguously permits Users to analyze
    performance metrics “to the extent permitted by law,” which may conflict with the broader restrictions stated
    elsewhere. Users and Customers should seek clarification if necessary to fully understand their rights and
    obligations regarding intellectual property.</p>

<h3>Ownership of Content</h3>
<p>All content uploaded, submitted, or otherwise provided by the User or Customer through the use of Tool_1, including
    but not limited to product data, reports, analytics inputs, and any related materials (collectively, the “Content”),
    shall remain the sole property of the party providing such Content. The Service provider does not claim ownership
    over User or Customer Content; however, by using the Service, Users grant the Service provider a worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, store, and process the Content solely for the purpose of
    delivering and improving the Service.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is some ambiguity within this Agreement regarding the extent to which the
    Service provider may use aggregated, anonymized Content for research or enhancement purposes. While certain clauses
    specify that such use will exclude any personally identifiable or confidential business information, other
    provisions vaguely allow for broader usage rights without clearly defining limits, potentially leading to differing
    interpretations of data usage rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer” are inconsistently applied in this section, occasionally suggesting that
    ownership rights may differ between these parties. For example, one clause implies that Customers hold exclusive
    rights to Content submitted under their account, whereas Users who operate under the Customer’s subscription may
    have limited ownership or usage rights. This lack of clear distinction may cause confusion regarding intellectual
    property rights in multi-user environments.</p>
<p>Users and Customers acknowledge that any unauthorized distribution, modification, or commercial exploitation of
    Content outside the scope of this Agreement is strictly prohibited and may result in legal consequences. The Service
    provider disclaims any liability for Content loss or alteration; therefore, Users and Customers are responsible for
    maintaining backups of their Content. If there is any conflict between this section and other parts of the Agreement
    concerning Content ownership or usage rights, the provisions granting the broadest rights to the Service provider
    shall prevail.</p>

<h3>License to Use the Service</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Service provider grants the User a limited, non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use Tool_1 solely for its intended purpose of obtaining
    AI-driven analytics and insights related to product management. This license permits the Customer and Users to
    utilize the Service for internal business operations in accordance with the scope of Services described herein. Any
    use of the Service beyond the expressly permitted purposes requires prior written consent from the Service
    provider.</p>
<p>The license granted herein does not convey any ownership rights in the Service or its underlying technology, nor does
    it allow the User or Customer to sublicense, distribute, or otherwise commercially exploit the Service or any part
    thereof. Users acknowledge that all intellectual property rights remain with the Service provider or its licensors,
    and that unauthorized use or duplication of the Service may result in termination of access and potential legal
    action.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the license allows both “User” and “Customer” to access the Service, the Agreement
    inconsistently refers to these parties throughout, causing potential ambiguity as to whether both have equal rights
    under this license or if certain restrictions apply differently. Furthermore, the duration of the license is tied to
    the User’s account status, but the terms regarding license termination and data retention post-termination vary
    within this Agreement, leading to some contradictory interpretations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Service provider reserves the right to suspend or revoke this license at any time, with or without
    prior notice, particularly in cases of breach of these Terms or misuse of the Service. Users and Customers are
    advised to review the Agreement regularly to ensure compliance and continued authorization to use Tool_1 under this
    license.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Use</h3>
<p>Users and Customers are expressly prohibited from using Tool_1 for any unlawful, unauthorized, or unethical purposes.
    Specifically, the Service must not be used to engage in activities that infringe upon intellectual property rights,
    violate privacy laws, or compromise the security and integrity of the Service or third-party systems. Neither User
    nor Customer shall attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service or its underlying infrastructure,
    nor shall they attempt to circumvent any access controls or authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Users and Customers must not utilize the Service to transmit, store, or distribute any material that is
    defamatory, discriminatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. Automated use of the Service, including but not
    limited to data scraping, excessive API calls, or other forms of bulk data extraction, is forbidden unless expressly
    permitted in writing by the Service provider. Attempts to disrupt or degrade the performance of Tool_1, whether
    intentional or negligent, may result in immediate suspension or termination of access.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some sections of this Agreement suggest that violations of these restrictions may lead to
    suspension only after a reasonable notice period; however, other clauses imply that immediate action can be taken
    without prior warning. This inconsistency may cause uncertainty regarding enforcement protocols. Additionally, the
    terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably in this section, without clear distinction as to
    which party bears primary responsibility for adherence to these restrictions, which could result in ambiguity in
    accountability.</p>
<p>Any breach of these restrictions shall entitle the Service provider to pursue all available legal remedies, including
    injunctive relief and damages. Users and Customers are advised to review these provisions carefully and ensure
    strict compliance to avoid any adverse consequences related to the misuse of Tool_1.</p>

<h2>Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
<p>The Service provider acknowledges the importance of protecting the privacy and security of the Data collected,
    processed, and stored through Tool_1. Both the User and Customer agree to comply with applicable data protection
    laws and regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant
    privacy frameworks. Personal data and sensitive information shall be handled in accordance with the Service
    provider’s Privacy Policy, which forms an integral part of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Service provider commits to implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard Data
    against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or disclosure. However, Users and Customers recognize that no method
    of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and the Service provider cannot guarantee absolute security of
    Data.</p>
<p>Regarding Data retention, this Agreement contains inconsistent provisions: some clauses state that all User Data will
    be permanently deleted immediately upon account Termination, while others permit retention of Data for a reasonable
    period to fulfill legal, regulatory, or operational obligations. This ambiguity may affect Users’ expectations
    concerning their Data’s lifecycle. Users and Customers are encouraged to consult the Privacy Policy or contact
    support for clarification on Data retention practices.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this section, the distinction between
    the roles and responsibilities of each party in relation to Data protection is not clearly delineated. This lack of
    precise terminology may lead to uncertainty regarding which party bears specific obligations under data protection
    laws.</p>
<p>By continuing to use Tool_1, Users and Customers consent to the collection, processing, and storage of Data as
    described herein and in the Privacy Policy. The Service provider reserves the right to update its data protection
    practices at any time, with changes becoming effective immediately upon posting on the Service platform or other
    notification mechanisms.</p>

<h3>Collection and Use of Data</h3>
<p>In order to provide the functionalities and services offered by Tool_1, the Service provider collects various types
    of Data from the User or Customer, including but not limited to product usage metrics, interaction logs, and
    behavioral analytics. This Data is used to generate actionable insights, improve predictive models, and enhance the
    overall performance and user experience of the Service. The Service provider may also collect technical information
    such as device identifiers, IP addresses, and browser types to facilitate Service delivery and security
    measures.</p>
<p>The Service provider commits to using Data solely for purposes consistent with the provision and improvement of
    Tool_1, as well as for compliance with legal obligations. However, certain clauses within this Agreement ambiguously
    describe the extent to which Data may be used for internal research or shared with third parties, without providing
    clear limits or definitions. Users and Customers should review the Privacy Policy for additional details regarding
    data use and sharing practices.</p>
<p>Data collection practices apply to both Users and Customers, though the Agreement inconsistently uses these terms,
    which may cause confusion concerning the specific responsibilities and rights related to Data provision and control.
    Furthermore, while some sections indicate that Data collected will be anonymized before any aggregated analysis,
    others imply that identifiable Data may be retained under unspecified conditions, leading to uncertainty about
    privacy safeguards.</p>
<p>By using Tool_1, the User or Customer consents to the collection, processing, and use of Data as outlined herein and
    in the Privacy Policy. Users should be aware that refusal to provide certain Data may limit access to or
    functionality of the Service. The Service provider reserves the right to update its data collection methodologies or
    purposes at any time, with such changes becoming effective immediately upon notification or posting on the Service
    platform.</p>

<h3>User Rights and Data Access</h3>
<p>Users and Customers are entitled to certain rights with respect to their Data collected or processed through Tool_1,
    subject to applicable laws and the terms of this Agreement. These rights include, but are not limited to, the
    ability to access, correct, or request deletion of personal Data, as well as the right to object to or restrict
    certain types of processing. Requests to exercise such rights should be submitted to the Service provider via the
    designated contact channels outlined in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a valid request, the Service provider will make reasonable efforts to respond within a timeframe
    consistent with applicable legal requirements. However, the term “reasonable efforts” is not explicitly defined in
    this Agreement, potentially leading to varied expectations regarding response times. Furthermore, while the
    Agreement states that Data will be deleted upon account Termination, some provisions allow for retention of Data for
    a “reasonable period” thereafter, creating ambiguity about the duration and extent of Data access rights
    post-Termination.</p>
<p>Access to Data may be provided via the Service’s user interface or through export functionalities where applicable.
    Both Users and Customers acknowledge that such access rights are subject to technical limitations and security
    considerations, and that fulfillment of access requests may require identity verification to protect against
    unauthorized disclosures.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the Agreement inconsistently refers to “User” and “Customer” when describing Data
    access rights, without clarifying whether these rights apply equally or differently among these parties. This
    inconsistency may affect the interpretation of who may make requests and the scope of Data subject to such requests.
    Users and Customers are encouraged to consult the Privacy Policy or contact support for further clarification
    regarding their specific rights and procedures related to Data access and management.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Data Sharing</h3>
<p>The Service provider may share certain Data collected through Tool_1 with third-party service providers, partners, or
    affiliates to facilitate the delivery, maintenance, and improvement of the Service. Such sharing is conducted under
    strict confidentiality agreements and only to the extent necessary to perform contracted services, including data
    hosting, analytics enhancement, and customer support functions. Users and Customers acknowledge and consent that
    their Data may be transferred to entities located in jurisdictions outside their own, which may have different data
    protection laws.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement contains some ambiguity regarding the scope and limitations of
    third-party Data sharing. While some clauses specify that personally identifiable information will never be
    disclosed without explicit consent, other sections imply that aggregated or anonymized Data may be shared broadly
    without restriction. This inconsistency may lead to uncertainty about the exact nature of Data disclosures to third
    parties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably within this section without
    clarifying whether both parties have the same rights or responsibilities concerning third-party Data sharing. For
    example, it is unclear if both Users and Customers must provide consent for such sharing or if consent from one
    party suffices. Additionally, there is a minor typographical error in some references to “third-party” as “third
    party” without a hyphen, which may affect the consistency of terminology throughout the document.</p>
<p>The Service provider commits to implementing reasonable safeguards to protect Data shared with third parties but
    disclaims liability for any unauthorized access or misuse by such parties beyond its reasonable control. Users and
    Customers are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy and contact the Service provider for further information or to
    address any concerns regarding third-party Data sharing practices.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Both the Service provider and the User or Customer acknowledge that during the course of using Tool_1, each party may
    have access to certain confidential and proprietary information (“Confidential Information”). Such information may
    include, but is not limited to, business strategies, technical data, product roadmaps, algorithms, trade secrets,
    and any other non-public information disclosed directly or indirectly in connection with the Service.</p>
<p>Each party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the other party’s Confidential Information and to exercise at
    least the same degree of care in protecting such information as it uses to protect its own confidential information,
    but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. Confidential Information shall not be disclosed to any
    third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, except as required by law or as necessary to
    provide or support the Service under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement contains some ambiguity regarding the treatment of aggregated and
    anonymized Data derived from the Service. Certain clauses imply that such Data may not be considered Confidential
    Information and may be used freely by the Service provider, while others suggest that even aggregated Data is
    subject to confidentiality obligations. Users and Customers should carefully review these provisions to understand
    their rights and limitations concerning data confidentiality.</p>
<p>Confidentiality obligations shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of two (2)
    years, unless otherwise agreed in writing. However, the Agreement inconsistently refers to the parties as “User” or
    “Customer” without clarifying if confidentiality applies equally to both or differs based on designation, which may
    lead to uncertainty regarding the scope of these obligations.</p>
<p>In the event of any unauthorized disclosure or breach of confidentiality, the affected party shall promptly notify
    the other party and cooperate in mitigating any potential damages. Remedies for breach of confidentiality may
    include injunctive relief, damages, or termination of access to the Service. Users and Customers are encouraged to
    implement internal policies consistent with these obligations to protect all Confidential Information exchanged
    under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Definition of Confidential Information</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all non-public information
    disclosed by either the Service provider or the User or Customer (collectively, the “Parties”) in connection with
    the use or provision of Tool_1. This includes, but is not limited to, business plans, technical data, software code,
    algorithms, product designs, marketing strategies, customer lists, pricing information, trade secrets, and any other
    proprietary or sensitive information regardless of the form or medium in which it is communicated.</p>
<p>Confidential Information also encompasses any Data or analytics outputs generated through the Service that are
    identified as confidential at the time of disclosure. However, there is some ambiguity in this definition as certain
    sections of this Agreement suggest that aggregated or anonymized Data derived from User or Customer inputs may not
    be considered Confidential Information, while other provisions imply that such Data remains subject to
    confidentiality obligations. This lack of clarity may affect the understanding of what information is protected
    under this clause.</p>
<p>Information shall not be deemed Confidential Information if it (a) was already known to the receiving Party at the
    time of disclosure without restriction on use or disclosure, (b) becomes publicly available through no fault of the
    receiving Party, (c) is rightfully received from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation, or
    (d) is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to the disclosing Party’s Confidential
    Information.</p>
<p>Notably, the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used inconsistently in this section and elsewhere in the
    Agreement, which may lead to confusion as to which party’s information is protected or subject to confidentiality
    obligations. Parties are advised to consider this ambiguity when identifying and handling Confidential Information
    under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Obligations of Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Each Party agrees to treat all Confidential Information received from the other Party with strict confidentiality and
    to use such information solely for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement. The receiving
    Party shall implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access,
    disclosure, or use of the Confidential Information. These safeguards shall be at least equivalent to those the
    receiving Party employs to protect its own confidential information, though the exact standard may vary depending on
    the nature of the information and the context of its use.</p>
<p>The Parties shall restrict access to Confidential Information to employees, contractors, or agents who have a
    legitimate need to know and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained
    herein. Disclosure of Confidential Information to any third party requires the prior written consent of the
    disclosing Party, except where disclosure is mandated by applicable law or regulation, in which case the receiving
    Party shall provide prompt notice to the disclosing Party to allow for protective measures.</p>
<p>Confidentiality obligations shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of two (2)
    years; however, certain provisions elsewhere in this Agreement suggest that some Confidential Information,
    particularly aggregated or anonymized Data, may be exempt from these obligations, which introduces ambiguity as to
    the scope and duration of confidentiality protections. Users and Customers should seek clarification if necessary to
    understand their ongoing responsibilities.</p>
<p>Notably, the Agreement alternates between referring to the receiving party as “User” or “Customer” without clear
    distinction, which may affect enforcement of confidentiality obligations depending on the recipient's designation.
    It is therefore recommended that all Parties clearly identify their role and responsibilities with respect to
    Confidential Information to ensure compliance.</p>

<h3>Exclusions from Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, certain categories of information shall be
    expressly excluded from the definition of Confidential Information and, therefore, shall not be subject to the
    restrictions outlined in this Agreement. Such exclusions include information that (a) is or becomes publicly
    available through no breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party; (b) was lawfully in the possession of the
    receiving Party prior to disclosure by the disclosing Party without any obligation of confidentiality; (c) is
    independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to or reliance upon the disclosing Party’s
    Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained by the receiving Party from a third party without
    restriction on use or disclosure.</p>
<p>Additionally, information that the receiving Party is required to disclose pursuant to applicable law, court order,
    or governmental regulation shall also be excluded from confidentiality protections, provided that the receiving
    Party gives prompt written notice to the disclosing Party to allow for protective actions, unless such notification
    is prohibited by law or regulation. In such cases, the receiving Party shall disclose only the minimum information
    necessary to comply with the legal requirement.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while this section refers to obligations of the “receiving Party,” the Agreement
    inconsistently uses the terms “User” and “Customer” without explicitly clarifying whether both or only one of these
    parties may assume this role in different contexts. This inconsistency may lead to ambiguity regarding which party
    holds responsibility for maintaining confidentiality or for making lawful disclosures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some clauses within this Agreement ambiguously suggest that aggregated or anonymized Data derived from
    the Service may be excluded from confidentiality obligations, while other provisions imply such Data remains
    protected. This ambiguity may result in differing interpretations of whether aggregated analytics outputs are
    subject to confidentiality restrictions. Parties are encouraged to seek clarification where necessary to avoid
    disputes related to the scope of Confidential Information exclusions.</p>

<h2>Liability and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>The Service provider shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary
    damages arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use Tool_1, including but not limited to
    damages for loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, even if the Service provider has been
    advised of the possibility of such damages. Users and Customers expressly acknowledge that the Service is provided
    “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, except as explicitly stated
    in a separate written agreement.</p>
<p>While the Service provider strives to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analytics and insights generated by
    Tool_1, it does not guarantee that the Service will be error-free, complete, or uninterrupted. The User or Customer
    assumes full responsibility for any decisions made based on the information provided through the Service. The
    Service provider disclaims any liability for errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the Data or analytics outputs, as
    well as any consequences arising from reliance on such information.</p>
<p>In certain clauses, the Agreement indicates that the Service provider’s liability is limited to direct damages up to
    the amount paid by the Customer in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. However, other sections suggest
    broader indemnification obligations without clearly defining their scope, potentially causing ambiguity regarding
    the extent of liability and remedies available. This inconsistency may affect Users’ and Customers’ understanding of
    their rights and protections under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably throughout this section, which may lead to
    confusion about which party is entitled to indemnification or subject to liability limitations. Users and Customers
    are encouraged to carefully review these provisions and seek legal advice if necessary to fully comprehend their
    liabilities and indemnity obligations.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit liability for death or personal injury caused by the Service
    provider’s negligence, or for any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. To the
    fullest extent permitted by law, the Service provider’s total aggregate liability under or in connection with this
    Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Customer for the Service during the preceding twelve (12)
    months.</p>

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the Service provider nor its affiliates, directors,
    employees, or agents shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
    arising out of or related to the use of Tool_1, including but not limited to loss of revenue, profits, data, or
    business opportunities, even if the Service provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The
    aggregate liability of the Service provider for any claim arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall
    not exceed the total fees paid by the Customer or User for the Service in the six (6) months immediately preceding
    the claim.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, this limitation shall not apply to damages resulting from gross negligence, willful
    misconduct, or breaches of confidentiality obligations. In addition, liability for personal injury or death caused
    by the Service provider’s negligence is not limited by this Agreement.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in some sections of this Agreement, the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably,
    while in others they imply different roles or responsibilities. This inconsistent terminology extends to limitation
    of liability provisions and may lead to ambiguity regarding which party may seek indemnification or is subject to
    liability caps. Parties are advised to clarify their status to understand their rights and liabilities fully.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the phrase “aggregate liability” is not explicitly defined herein, which might cause uncertainty about
    whether multiple claims arising from separate incidents are cumulatively capped or subject to individual limits.
    Users and Customers should consider this when assessing their potential exposure under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Finally, the Service provider disclaims any liability for third-party claims arising from the User’s or Customer’s
    misuse of the Service, unauthorized access, or violation of applicable laws, irrespective of notification or prior
    knowledge.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
<p>TOOL_1 IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
    NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE SERVICE PROVIDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS,
    RELIABILITY, OR TIMELINESS OF THE DATA, ANALYTICS, OR INSIGHTS GENERATED BY THE SERVICE.</p>
<p>WHILE THE SERVICE PROVIDER STRIVES TO MAINTAIN HIGH STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE AND AVAILABILITY, IT DOES NOT WARRANT
    THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, NOR DOES IT GUARANTEE THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED
    WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIMEFRAME. USERS AND CUSTOMERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TECHNICAL ISSUES, INCLUDING SOFTWARE BUGS, NETWORK
    INTERRUPTIONS, OR OTHER UNFORESEEN EVENTS, MAY OCCUR AND IMPACT SERVICE USABILITY.</p>
<p>THE SERVICE PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS OR CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH TOOL_1,
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COMPATIBILITY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND SECURITY. USERS AND CUSTOMERS ASSUME ALL RISKS
    ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IN WHICH CASE
    SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE TERMS “USER”
    AND “CUSTOMER” ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY IN THIS SECTION, WHICH MAY LEAD TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING WHICH PARTY’S
    RIGHTS ARE AFFECTED BY THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>IN ADDITION, THIS SECTION CONTRADICTORILY STATES THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTIES ABOUT “TIMELINESS” OF
    DATA, WHILE ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT IT COMMITS TO MAINTAINING PERFORMANCE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY STANDARDS.
    USERS AND CUSTOMERS SHOULD REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT IN FULL TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS THAT
    APPLY.</p>

<h3>Indemnification</h3>
<p>The Customer and User (collectively referred to as “Indemnifying Party”) agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
    harmless the Service provider, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents (the “Indemnified
    Parties”) from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including
    reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to (i) the Indemnifying Party’s use or misuse of Tool_1; (ii)
    any violation of this Agreement or applicable laws by the Indemnifying Party; (iii) any breach of representations,
    warranties, or covenants made herein; or (iv) any third-party claim resulting from Content uploaded, submitted, or
    transmitted through the Service by the Indemnifying Party.</p>
<p>The Indemnifying Party’s obligation to indemnify shall include any claims arising from infringement or alleged
    infringement of intellectual property rights, unauthorized use of third-party materials, or violation of privacy or
    data protection laws. The Service provider reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any
    matter subject to indemnification, at its own expense, and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate fully with the
    Service provider in such defense.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scope and extent of indemnification obligations may vary depending on whether the
    party is designated as a “User” or a “Customer.” This Agreement inconsistently uses these terms without clearly
    specifying which party holds primary indemnification responsibility, potentially leading to ambiguity in
    enforcement. Additionally, in some clauses, indemnification is conditioned upon the Indemnified Party promptly
    notifying the Indemnifying Party of any claims, yet the timeframe for such notice is undefined, which may affect the
    Indemnifying Party’s ability to respond effectively.</p>
<p>In cases where the Indemnifying Party fails to fulfill its indemnification obligations, the Service provider reserves
    the right to suspend or terminate access to the Service without prior notice. Users and Customers are encouraged to
    review these provisions carefully and seek legal counsel to fully understand their indemnity responsibilities under
    this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>Either the Service provider or the User or Customer may terminate this Agreement and the associated access to Tool_1
    at any time, with or without cause, by providing notice to the other party. The required notice period for
    termination is described in some sections of this Agreement as a “reasonable period,” though this term is not
    explicitly defined, potentially leading to differing interpretations regarding the timing and sufficiency of such
    notice. Termination may also occur immediately in the event of material breach, including but not limited to
    violation of prohibited activities or non-payment of fees.</p>
<p>Upon termination, the User’s or Customer’s access to the Service will be revoked, and any active subscriptions or
    payment obligations shall cease, subject to the terms of the applicable subscription agreement. The Service provider
    will endeavor to delete all User Data promptly following termination; however, conflicting provisions within this
    Agreement alternately require immediate deletion and retention of Data for a reasonable period to comply with legal,
    regulatory, or operational needs. This inconsistency may affect expectations regarding data availability after
    termination.</p>
<p>Termination shall not relieve either party of any liabilities or obligations incurred prior to the effective date of
    termination, including payment of outstanding fees or confidentiality obligations. Additionally, while the Agreement
    generally treats “User” and “Customer” as interchangeable, certain clauses imply that termination rights and
    responsibilities may differ between these parties without clear delineation. Users and Customers should review this
    section carefully to understand their respective rights and duties upon termination.</p>
<p>In the event of termination initiated by the Service provider due to breach or non-compliance, no refunds will be
    issued for any fees paid, and the terminated party shall remain liable for any damages resulting from such breach.
    The Service provider reserves the right to suspend or disable access immediately if termination is due to
    misconduct, with or without prior notice, notwithstanding other provisions that suggest notice within a reasonable
    timeframe.</p>

<h3>Termination by User</h3>
<p>The User may terminate their access to Tool_1 at any time by providing notice to the Service provider in accordance
    with the terms set forth in this Agreement. While some sections refer to a “reasonable period” for providing
    termination notice, this Agreement does not explicitly define the duration or format of such notice, which may
    result in differing interpretations regarding the adequacy of termination communications. Users are advised to
    submit termination requests in writing via the designated contact channels to ensure proper processing.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a termination notice from the User, the Service provider will deactivate the User’s account and cease
    provision of Service access. However, conflicting provisions within this Agreement create ambiguity as to whether
    User Data will be deleted immediately upon termination or retained for a reasonable period to fulfill legal or
    operational obligations. Users should be aware that Data retention practices may vary and are subject to the Service
    provider’s discretion, potentially affecting data availability post-termination.</p>
<p>Termination by the User shall not relieve them of any outstanding payment obligations incurred prior to the effective
    date of termination. Depending on the subscription terms, early termination may result in fees or penalties, though
    the Agreement does not consistently specify these conditions or the circumstances under which they apply.
    Additionally, the terms “User” and “Customer” are sometimes used interchangeably in this context, which may cause
    confusion as to whether termination rights and obligations apply equally to both parties or differ depending on
    their designation.</p>
<p>Users are encouraged to review their subscription agreement carefully and contact Customer support to clarify any
    questions regarding termination procedures, data handling, or financial responsibilities. Continued use of the
    Service following submission of a termination request may be interpreted as withdrawal of the termination notice,
    unless expressly confirmed otherwise by the Service provider.</p>

<h3>Termination by Provider</h3>
<p>The Service provider reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to Tool_1 for the User or Customer at any
    time, with or without cause, and with or without prior notice. Termination may be effectuated immediately in cases
    of material breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to violations of prohibited activities, non-payment
    of fees, or failure to comply with applicable laws. In other instances, the Service provider may provide notice
    within a reasonable period prior to termination; however, the term “reasonable period” is not explicitly defined
    herein, which may result in varying interpretations regarding the timing and sufficiency of such notice.</p>
<p>Upon termination by the Service provider, the affected User’s or Customer’s access to the Service will be revoked and
    any active subscriptions will be canceled. The Service provider will endeavor to delete all associated Data
    promptly; however, conflicting provisions within this Agreement alternately require immediate deletion upon
    termination or retention of Data for a reasonable period to satisfy legal, regulatory, or operational requirements.
    This inconsistency may create uncertainty about the handling of Data post-termination.</p>
<p>Termination by the Service provider shall not relieve the User or Customer of any outstanding payment obligations or
    liabilities incurred prior to termination. Furthermore, while this section refers to both “User” and “Customer,” the
    Agreement inconsistently applies these terms without clarifying whether termination rights or consequences differ
    between them, potentially leading to ambiguity in enforcement.</p>
<p>The Service provider retains the right to suspend or terminate access without prior notice in emergency situations,
    such as security breaches or critical system failures, notwithstanding any provisions suggesting notice should be
    given within a reasonable timeframe. Users and Customers are encouraged to regularly review this Agreement and
    maintain communication with the Service provider to understand their rights and obligations regarding
    termination.</p>

<h3>Effects of Termination</h3>
<p>Upon termination of this Agreement, whether initiated by the User, Customer, or the Service provider, all rights and
    licenses granted to the User or Customer to access and use Tool_1 shall immediately cease. The User or Customer must
    discontinue any use of the Service and delete or return any proprietary materials or Confidential Information
    obtained during the term of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Termination shall not affect accrued
    rights, outstanding payment obligations, or any provisions of this Agreement that by their nature are intended to
    survive termination.</p>
<p>The Service provider will deactivate the User’s or Customer’s account and revoke all access credentials promptly
    following termination. While some provisions of this Agreement state that all User Data and Content will be
    permanently deleted immediately upon termination, other clauses permit retention of such Data for a reasonable
    period to comply with legal, regulatory, or operational requirements. This inconsistency may cause uncertainty
    regarding the exact timelines and conditions under which Data will be retained or deleted post-termination.</p>
<p>Users and Customers should be aware that during any Data retention period, the Service provider will continue to
    safeguard the Data in accordance with the confidentiality and data protection obligations set forth herein. However,
    the Agreement does not explicitly specify whether the retained Data remains accessible to the User or Customer
    during this period, creating ambiguity about post-termination Data access rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any outstanding fees or charges incurred prior to termination remain due and payable by the Customer or
    User despite termination. The terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this section, potentially
    leading to confusion about which party holds specific responsibilities related to post-termination obligations. It
    is recommended that Users and Customers seek clarification from the Service provider if there is any uncertainty
    regarding their duties or entitlements after termination.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Service provider and the User or Customer regarding
    the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior agreements, representations, or communications, whether written
    or oral. Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by authorized
    representatives of both parties, unless otherwise stated within this document. However, certain clauses in this
    Agreement imply that unilateral modifications by the Service provider may be effective upon posting, creating
    potential ambiguity about the enforceability of such updates.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be interpreted in a manner
    that best reflects the original intent of the parties. The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision
    under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision, nor shall it prevent future
    enforcement.</p>
<p>The terms “User” and “Customer” are used inconsistently throughout this Agreement, and for the purposes of this
    section, they shall be considered collectively unless otherwise specified. This interchangeable use may lead to some
    uncertainty regarding specific rights and obligations, especially in scenarios involving multiple Users under a
    single Customer account.</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    Service provider is incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising out of or
    related to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration, except where prohibited by law.
    The location, rules, and procedures for arbitration shall be determined by the Service provider at its sole
    discretion unless mutually agreed upon by the parties. This discretionary authority may introduce unpredictability
    for the User or Customer seeking dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control,
    including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, or governmental actions. Such force
    majeure events shall excuse performance for the duration of the impediment.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    Service provider is incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The User and Customer
    acknowledge and agree that any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively
    under the laws of this jurisdiction, unless otherwise explicitly agreed in writing by the parties.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain provisions of this Agreement may be subject to mandatory laws applicable to
    the User’s or Customer’s place of residence or business, which may afford rights or impose obligations that cannot
    be waived or modified by contract. In such cases, the applicable mandatory laws shall prevail to the extent of any
    inconsistency with this Agreement.</p>
<p>For the purpose of clarity, the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this section, without a clear
    distinction as to whether both parties are equally bound by the governing law or if different legal considerations
    may apply based on their designation. This lack of precision may lead to ambiguity concerning the jurisdictional
    rights and obligations of each party.</p>
<p>Any legal actions or proceedings arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the
    courts located within the jurisdiction of the Service provider’s incorporation, and the User and Customer hereby
    consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. However, the Agreement also provides for binding arbitration as
    the primary dispute resolution mechanism, which may create some uncertainty about whether court proceedings or
    arbitration will ultimately govern the resolution of disputes in specific instances.</p>
<p>Users and Customers are encouraged to consult legal counsel to understand the implications of the governing law
    provisions and to clarify their rights and obligations under this Agreement in light of their particular
    circumstances and jurisdictional considerations.</p>

<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of Tool_1,
    the User and Customer (collectively, the “Parties”) agree to first attempt to resolve the matter amicably through
    good faith negotiations. Such negotiations shall commence promptly upon written notice by either Party describing
    the nature of the dispute.</p>
<p>If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within a reasonable period, which is not explicitly defined herein
    and may be subject to differing interpretations, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration as the
    exclusive remedy. Arbitration shall be conducted in the jurisdiction where the Service provider is incorporated,
    under rules determined by the Service provider unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing. This discretionary
    authority regarding arbitration procedures may create unpredictability for the User or Customer seeking
    resolution.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the arbitration requirement, either Party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of
    competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm or protect Confidential Information without waiving the
    obligation to arbitrate other claims. It should be noted that the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used
    interchangeably in this section, which may cause ambiguity concerning who may initiate such proceedings or the scope
    of claims subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>The Parties acknowledge that any arbitration award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be
    entered in any court having jurisdiction. Costs and fees of arbitration shall be borne as determined by the
    arbitrator, although the Agreement does not specify whether the Service provider or the User/Customer bears the
    initial costs, creating potential uncertainty regarding financial responsibility.</p>
<p>By agreeing to these Terms, Users and Customers waive their right to a trial by jury or to participate in
    class-action lawsuits related to the Service. Users and Customers are encouraged to carefully review this section
    and seek legal advice to understand the implications of arbitration and dispute resolution under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement, including the Privacy Policy and any referenced documents, constitutes the complete and exclusive
    understanding between the Service provider and the User or Customer concerning the subject matter herein. It
    supersedes all prior oral or written communications, proposals, agreements, or understandings, whether explicit or
    implied, relating to the use of Tool_1. No other agreements, promises, or representations made by either party that
    are not expressly included in this Agreement shall be binding or enforceable.</p>
<p>Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of
    both the Service provider and the User or Customer, unless otherwise stipulated within this document. However,
    certain sections of this Agreement suggest that the Service provider may unilaterally update terms by posting
    revised versions on the Service platform, which may lead to ambiguity regarding the enforceability of such changes
    without explicit consent from the User or Customer.</p>
<p>For clarity, the terms “User” and “Customer” used throughout this Agreement are intended to collectively encompass
    all parties accessing or utilizing Tool_1, though the interchangeable use of these terms without clear delineation
    may cause some uncertainty regarding their precise rights and obligations under this Agreement. Users and Customers
    are encouraged to carefully review the entire Agreement to understand the full scope of their commitments and
    entitlements.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any other document or communication relating to the Service,
    the terms of this Agreement shall prevail unless specifically overridden by a duly executed written agreement signed
    by both parties. The integration of all terms in this Agreement is intended to avoid any misunderstanding or
    disputes regarding the parties’ contractual relationship and the use of Tool_1.</p>

<h3>Amendments</h3>
<p>The Service provider reserves the right to amend, modify, or update these Terms of Service at any time. Such
    amendments may be necessary to reflect changes in legal requirements, business practices, or technological
    advancements relevant to the provision of Tool_1. Users and Customers acknowledge and agree that continued use of
    the Service after any such amendments shall constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
<p>Notice of material amendments will generally be provided to the User or Customer via email or through prominent
    notifications on the Service platform. However, certain provisions within this Agreement state that amendments may
    take effect immediately upon posting without prior notice, creating potential inconsistency regarding the timing and
    manner of notification. This ambiguity may affect Users' and Customers’ awareness and understanding of changes to
    their rights and obligations.</p>
<p>Amendments will be binding on both Users and Customers once effective, notwithstanding any differences in the use of
    these terms throughout this Agreement. It is the responsibility of each party to regularly review the Terms to stay
    informed of any updates. Failure to review or acknowledge such amendments does not exempt the User or Customer from
    compliance.</p>
<p>In cases where an amendment materially alters the scope of the Service or the responsibilities of the User or
    Customer, the Service provider may, at its sole discretion, allow a reasonable period for Users or Customers to
    accept or reject the changes. However, the term “reasonable period” is not explicitly defined herein, leading to
    potential uncertainties regarding the duration and conditions under which such acceptance must be made.</p>
<p>Should the User or Customer choose not to accept any material amendment, their sole remedy is to terminate use of the
    Service in accordance with the termination provisions set forth within this Agreement. Users and Customers are
    encouraged to seek clarification from the Service provider regarding any amendments that may impact their use of
    Tool_1 or their contractual rights.</p>
