    <title>Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Tool_1</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Tool_1</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") sets forth the terms and conditions under which Tool_1 ("Service Provider")
    agrees to provide its AI Analytics platform ("Service") to the Customer ("User") for the purpose of delivering
    actionable insights and predictive analysis tailored to product managers. The Service is designed to assist product
    development teams in optimizing workflows and enhancing user experience through advanced data analytics.</p>
<p>The intent of this Agreement is to establish clear expectations regarding the availability, performance, and support
    obligations of the Service Provider. By subscribing to Tool_1, the User acknowledges and agrees to the terms
    outlined herein, which govern the delivery and maintenance of the Service.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Customer" and "User" may be used interchangeably to refer to the
    entity or individual subscribing to the Service, although certain provisions may apply differently depending on the
    context. This Agreement shall remain effective until terminated by either party in accordance with the termination
    provisions detailed herein.</p>
<p>It is understood that the Service will be available to the Customer on a 24/7 basis, subject to scheduled maintenance
    periods and unforeseen outages. The Service Provider commits to restoring any service interruptions within a
    reasonable time frame; however, the exact duration of this period is subject to the discretion of the Service
    Provider.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this Agreement is to define the responsibilities and obligations of both the Service Provider
    and the Customer in relation to the provision and use of Tool_1. This Agreement aims to ensure that the Service
    operates in a manner that meets the expectations of the Customer while maintaining the integrity and performance
    standards established by the Service Provider.</p>
<p>Through this Agreement, the Service Provider intends to deliver a platform that enables product managers to derive
    meaningful insights from data analytics, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making in product development.
    The scope of the Service includes data processing, predictive modeling, and the provision of actionable
    recommendations based on the analytics performed.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that the Customer agrees to use the Service in compliance with any applicable laws and
    regulations, as well as the terms set forth herein. The Service Provider retains the right to modify the Service
    features or functionality at its sole discretion, provided that such modifications do not materially degrade the
    performance or availability of the Service.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider commits to maintaining the availability of the Service, the exact thresholds for uptime
    and response times are not explicitly defined in this Agreement, leaving room for potential interpretation.
    Additionally, the terms "User" and "Customer" will be used interchangeably throughout this document without strict
    differentiation, which may cause minor confusion regarding the roles and responsibilities attributed to each
    party.</p>

<h3>Scope of Services</h3>
<p>The Service Provider agrees to deliver the Tool_1 platform as a comprehensive AI Analytics solution tailored
    specifically for product managers. The scope of the Service includes, but is not limited to, data ingestion,
    processing, and analysis; generation of predictive models; and provision of actionable insights aimed at optimizing
    product development processes and enhancing user experience.</p>
<p>The Service will be accessible via a cloud-based interface, enabling the Customer to interact with dashboards,
    reports, and predictive tools. The Service Provider shall ensure continuous updates to the underlying algorithms and
    data models to reflect the latest advancements in AI and analytics technologies. However, the frequency and timing
    of such updates are at the sole discretion of the Service Provider and may occasionally result in temporary
    disruptions or changes in functionality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider will offer technical support to the Customer during standard business hours,
    defined as 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time on weekdays. Notwithstanding this, the Service Provider endeavors to
    address critical issues outside these hours, but no guaranteed support response times are specified herein. The
    Customer acknowledges that the terms "User" and "Customer" may be used interchangeably in this document and that
    references to either term within this section apply equally to all subscribed entities.</p>
<p>Data retention policies are designed to maintain Customer data for a minimum of 12 months following account
    termination. Contradictorily, elsewhere in this Agreement, it is stated that all Customer data will be permanently
    deleted immediately upon termination, which may lead to ambiguity regarding data handling post-termination. The
    Customer is responsible for ensuring that all data uploaded to the Service complies with applicable laws and
    regulations, including but not limited to data privacy and intellectual property rights.</p>

<h3>Definitions and Terminology</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them unless otherwise
    clearly indicated by the context:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Provider:</strong> Refers to the entity responsible for delivering the Tool_1 platform and
        associated services, including maintenance, support, and updates.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Customer:</strong> The individual or organization subscribing to the Service, who is authorized to use
        Tool_1. The term "User" may also be used interchangeably with "Customer" throughout this Agreement, although
        this usage may cause some ambiguity in certain provisions.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Service:</strong> The AI Analytics platform known as Tool_1, which provides data ingestion, predictive
        modeling, and actionable insights tailored for product managers.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Downtime:</strong> Any period during which the Service is unavailable to the Customer due to system
        failures, maintenance, or unforeseen outages. The term "unavailability" may be used synonymously, though slight
        distinctions might apply depending on context.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Scheduled Maintenance:</strong> Preplanned periods during which the Service Provider performs updates,
        patches, or improvements to the Service. Notification of such maintenance shall be provided within a reasonable
        timeframe, though the exact duration of notification is not explicitly defined herein.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Retention Period:</strong> The timeframe during which Customer data will be stored following
        account termination. While one section specifies a minimum retention of 12 months, elsewhere it is implied that
        data will be deleted immediately upon termination, creating an inconsistency in data handling policies.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Support Hours:</strong> The designated times during which the Service Provider offers technical
        assistance, generally defined as weekdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time. Critical issues may be addressed
        outside these hours at the Service Provider's discretion without guaranteed response times.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It is acknowledged that some terms used herein may overlap or be subject to interpretation, and the Customer agrees
    to seek clarification from the Service Provider should any ambiguity arise regarding terminology or obligations.</p>

<h2>Service Commitments</h2>
<p>The Service Provider commits to delivering the Tool_1 platform with commercially reasonable efforts to ensure high
    availability and reliable performance. Specifically, the Service Provider aims to maintain an uptime of at least
    99.5% during each calendar month, excluding periods of Scheduled Maintenance and Force Majeure events. However, this
    uptime threshold is provided as a target rather than a guaranteed service level, and no financial credits or
    penalties shall apply in the event of non-compliance.</p>
<p>Scheduled Maintenance will be communicated to the Customer at least 24 hours in advance via email or dashboard
    notifications. Nevertheless, the Service Provider reserves the right to perform emergency maintenance without prior
    notice if such action is deemed necessary to protect the security or integrity of the Service. During these
    maintenance windows, service availability may be temporarily reduced or interrupted.</p>
<p>Response times for support inquiries vary based on severity levels. High-priority issues reported by the Customer
    will be acknowledged within 4 business hours, whereas standard inquiries may receive responses within 2 business
    days. It is important to note that these timeframes are targets and not guaranteed commitments.</p>
<p>In respect to data handling, the Service Provider commits to retaining Customer data consistent with the Data
    Retention Period defined elsewhere in this Agreement. However, the exact duration for data retention
    post-termination remains subject to interpretation, as earlier sections provide conflicting information regarding
    immediate deletion versus a 12-month retention period. Customers are encouraged to clarify these terms prior to
    account closure to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Finally, while the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably throughout this document, the Service
    Provider considers these terms to encompass all authorized individuals accessing the Service under the Customer’s
    account. Any discrepancies in terminology should be interpreted in favor of the broader definition unless otherwise
    explicitly stated.</p>

<h3>Service Availability</h3>
<p>The Service Provider endeavors to ensure that the Tool_1 platform is available to the Customer on a continuous basis,
    subject to the limitations outlined herein. Service availability is defined as the period during which the Service
    is accessible and fully operational, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and periods of Downtime caused by circumstances
    beyond the reasonable control of the Service Provider, including Force Majeure events.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider targets an uptime percentage of 99.5% per calendar month, this figure represents an
    aspirational goal rather than a contractual guarantee. The Customer acknowledges that occasional interruptions may
    occur, and the Service Provider disclaims any liability arising from such unavailability. Furthermore, the exact
    definitions of “availability” and “downtime” may vary slightly depending on context, as these terms are used
    somewhat interchangeably throughout this Agreement.</p>
<p>Scheduled Maintenance will typically be conducted during off-peak hours to minimize disruption, with advance
    notification provided to the Customer at least 24 hours prior. However, in certain instances, the Service Provider
    may perform maintenance without prior notice if deemed critical to safeguard the Service’s security or stability.
    Such emergency maintenance may result in temporary unavailability without any obligation for compensation or
    alternative arrangements.</p>
<p>The Service Provider commits to restoring access to the Service as promptly as possible following any outage;
    however, the phrase “reasonable time frame” used herein regarding service restoration is intentionally vague and
    subject to the Service Provider’s sole discretion. This ambiguity may result in differing interpretations between
    the parties concerning expected recovery times.</p>
<p>Lastly, references to the “User” within this section should be interpreted to include the “Customer” and any
    authorized representatives thereof, consistent with the interchangeable use of these terms throughout the
    Agreement.</p>

<h4>Uptime Guarantee</h4>
<p>The Service Provider endeavors to deliver the Tool_1 platform with a high degree of availability, targeting an uptime
    of 99.5% during each calendar month. This uptime percentage is calculated based on total minutes of Service
    availability divided by the total minutes in the month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and any Downtime resulting
    from Force Majeure events or Customer-caused issues.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, this uptime figure shall not be construed as a binding guarantee or warranty. The
    Service Provider explicitly disclaims any financial liability or obligation to provide service credits or other
    remedies should the actual uptime fall below the targeted threshold. Customers acknowledge that the Service may
    experience unplanned interruptions or degradations, and such occurrences shall not constitute a breach of this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>For clarity, Scheduled Maintenance windows are excluded from the uptime calculation; however, the notice period for
    such maintenance is described elsewhere as "at least 24 hours," though in certain emergency situations prior notice
    may be omitted. This inconsistency may affect the Customer’s expectations regarding planned service
    interruptions.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the term "User" is predominantly used throughout this section, it is intended to encompass the
    Customer and any authorized users under the Customer’s account. This interchangeable terminology, however, may
    introduce slight ambiguity when determining responsibility for reporting downtime or seeking remedies.</p>
<p>In the event that uptime falls below the stated target for three consecutive months, the Customer may request a
    review meeting with the Service Provider to discuss potential improvements. Yet, no specific escalation procedures
    or compensatory measures are guaranteed under this Agreement, leaving the resolution process subject to mutual
    agreement.</p>

<h4>Scheduled Maintenance</h4>
<p>Scheduled Maintenance refers to prearranged periods during which the Service Provider performs necessary updates,
    patches, or improvements to the Tool_1 platform to ensure optimal performance and security. The Service Provider
    commits to providing the Customer with advance notice of such maintenance activities, generally at least 24 hours
    prior to commencement, through email notifications and dashboard alerts. However, the exact timing and frequency of
    Scheduled Maintenance are subject to change at the sole discretion of the Service Provider, and no fixed schedule is
    guaranteed.</p>
<p>During Scheduled Maintenance windows, the Service may experience partial or complete unavailability. While these
    maintenance periods are typically planned during off-peak hours to minimize disruption, the Service Provider does
    not warrant that all Scheduled Maintenance will be confined to such times. Furthermore, the Service Provider
    reserves the right to reschedule or extend maintenance activities without prior notice if deemed necessary for
    security or operational reasons, which may conflict with earlier commitments regarding notification periods.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges that any data processing or transactions occurring immediately prior to or during Scheduled
    Maintenance may be delayed or interrupted. It is recommended that Customers plan critical activities accordingly, as
    the Service Provider shall not be held liable for any losses or damages arising from such interruptions. References
    to the "User" within this section should be interpreted to include the Customer and any authorized users, consistent
    with the interchangeable terminology used throughout this Agreement.</p>
<p>Lastly, the term "reasonable timeframe" is occasionally used in relation to notification and completion of Scheduled
    Maintenance, but this phrase is not explicitly defined within the Agreement, thereby introducing potential ambiguity
    regarding expectations for communication and duration. The Service Provider encourages the Customer to seek
    clarification should any uncertainty regarding maintenance protocols arise.</p>

<h3>Performance Standards</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall endeavor to maintain performance levels of the Tool_1 platform that meet or exceed
    industry standards for AI Analytics services. This includes ensuring that predictive models and data processing
    functions operate with a high degree of accuracy, reliability, and timeliness. While the Service Provider aims to
    optimize response times for data queries and analytics generation, no explicit performance benchmarks or guaranteed
    throughput rates are established in this Agreement, leaving interpretation of acceptable performance to the Service
    Provider’s discretion.</p>
<p>The Service Provider commits to monitoring system performance continuously and implementing necessary improvements to
    address any degradation in service quality. However, the Customer acknowledges that occasional fluctuations in
    performance may occur due to factors beyond the Service Provider’s control, such as network latency, third-party
    integrations, or variable data volumes. In such instances, the Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable
    efforts to rectify issues within a reasonable period, though “reasonable period” is not specifically defined herein,
    potentially leading to differing expectations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this section without clear distinction. For the
    avoidance of doubt, all performance obligations apply equally to any authorized user accessing the Service under the
    Customer’s account. The Service Provider does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Service but
    strives to minimize any disruptions that impact the effectiveness of the analytics provided.</p>
<p>Finally, performance measurement metrics, including accuracy thresholds for predictive outputs, may be updated
    periodically without prior notice. Such updates could result in variations in analytic results or processing speed,
    and the Customer accepts these possible changes as part of ongoing Service evolution.</p>

<h4>Response Times</h4>
<p>The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to Customer inquiries and support requests
    in a timely manner. Response times vary depending on the severity and nature of the issue reported. For critical
    issues that severely impact the Service functionality or data integrity, the Service Provider aims to acknowledge
    such requests within 4 business hours during Support Hours. For non-critical or general support inquiries, the
    target response time is within 2 business days. However, these timeframes are targets and do not constitute
    guaranteed service levels or commitments.</p>
<p>It is noted that the term "User" is used interchangeably with "Customer" throughout this Agreement, and for the
    purposes of this section, any request submitted by a User or Customer shall be subject to the same response
    standards. Nevertheless, no explicit distinction is made regarding priority or escalation procedures for multiple
    Users under the same Customer account, which may lead to ambiguity in managing concurrent support requests.</p>
<p>Requests submitted outside of the defined Support Hours—weekdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time—will be addressed
    during the next business day unless classified as critical, in which case the Service Provider will endeavor to
    provide a response as soon as practicable. The phrase "as soon as practicable" is intentionally vague and may result
    in differing interpretations regarding expected response times for out-of-hours support.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider reserves the right to modify these response time targets without prior notice,
    which could affect Customer expectations. The Customer acknowledges that factors such as request complexity, volume
    of inquiries, and third-party dependencies may influence actual response times. The Service Provider disclaims any
    liability for delays beyond the stated targets and does not guarantee continuous or immediate assistance outside the
    scope of the defined Support Hours.</p>

<h4>Resolution Times</h4>
<p>The Service Provider shall endeavor to resolve reported issues in a timely and efficient manner, commensurate with
    the severity and complexity of the problem. For high-priority incidents that critically impair the functionality or
    availability of the Service, the Service Provider aims to resolve such issues within 24 hours from acknowledgment.
    For standard or low-priority issues, resolution may take up to 7 business days. However, these resolution targets
    are aspirational and not guaranteed, and the Customer agrees that actual resolution times may vary based on
    circumstances beyond the Service Provider’s control.</p>
<p>It is noted that the term “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement; however, in the
    context of resolution times, the Service Provider may prioritize issues reported by the Customer’s primary account
    holder, potentially leading to discrepancies in support experiences among different authorized Users. Furthermore,
    resolution times may be affected by the Customer’s responsiveness in providing necessary information or access to
    facilitate troubleshooting.</p>
<p>The Service Provider may also require additional time to investigate complex issues that involve third-party
    integrations or underlying data inconsistencies. In such cases, the resolution period may extend beyond the stated
    targets, and the Customer will be informed of any anticipated delays within a reasonable timeframe, although
    “reasonable timeframe” is not explicitly defined herein.</p>
<p>In instances where resolution is delayed due to factors beyond the Service Provider’s reasonable control, including
    but not limited to force majeure events or Customer-caused issues, the Service Provider shall not be held liable for
    any resulting impacts. The Customer acknowledges and accepts that the absence of binding resolution timeframes may
    result in variable response outcomes and agrees to cooperate fully to facilitate timely issue resolution.</p>

<h2>Support Services</h2>
<p>The Service Provider agrees to offer Support Services to the Customer for the duration of the Agreement, aimed at
    assisting with the use and troubleshooting of the Tool_1 platform. Support will be made available primarily during
    the defined Support Hours, which are weekdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time. Response efforts outside these
    hours will be provided at the Service Provider’s discretion and are not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Support Services include technical assistance related to platform functionality, guidance on feature usage, and
    resolution of issues arising from the Service. The Customer may submit support requests via the designated
    communication channels, including email, support portal, or telephone. While the Service Provider intends to respond
    to all inquiries promptly, no explicit guarantees regarding response or resolution times apply, and differing
    priorities may affect the order in which requests are handled.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably in this section and elsewhere
    in the Agreement, which may create occasional ambiguity regarding which party is responsible for submitting support
    requests and receiving communications. The Service Provider assumes that any authorized User within the Customer’s
    account may initiate support interactions unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Support Services do not cover issues resulting from unauthorized modifications, third-party software conflicts, or
    misuse of the Service by the Customer or its Users. Furthermore, the Service Provider reserves the right to charge
    additional fees for support requests deemed outside the scope of standard assistance, though such charges will be
    communicated prior to service delivery.</p>
<p>Lastly, while the Service Provider endeavors to maintain a high standard of Support Services, the absence of defined
    escalation procedures or guaranteed resolution timelines means that the Customer may experience variability in
    support outcomes. The Customer is encouraged to provide clear and detailed information when submitting requests to
    facilitate efficient resolution.</p>

<h3>Support Tiers</h3>
<p>The Service Provider offers multiple Support Tiers designed to accommodate varying levels of Customer needs and
    service expectations. These tiers range from Basic Support, included with the standard subscription, to Premium
    Support, which may be procured for an additional fee. Each Support Tier provides differing scopes of service,
    response priorities, and availability hours, though precise distinctions between tiers are not exhaustively detailed
    in this Agreement, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding the exact scope and benefits of each tier.</p>
<p>The Basic Support Tier includes access to the Service Provider’s standard support channels during the defined Support
    Hours, with no guaranteed response or resolution times beyond the general targets described in the Support Services
    section. Premium Support Tier customers receive enhanced assistance, including prioritized response times and access
    to a dedicated support representative. However, the Service Provider reserves the right to modify or discontinue any
    Support Tier offerings without prior notice, which may affect the continuity of service levels provided under this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>It is noted that while references to “Customer” are predominant in this section, the term “User” may occasionally be
    used interchangeably, potentially causing some confusion about eligibility and entitlements under each Support Tier.
    Furthermore, the Service Provider does not guarantee that escalations within Support Tiers will result in faster
    resolution, as resolution timelines remain subject to operational considerations and resource availability.</p>
<p>Customers opting for Premium Support are subject to additional terms and conditions, which will be provided
    separately and are not incorporated herein by reference. The Service Provider encourages Customers to review those
    terms carefully, as they may contain provisions that supersede or supplement this Agreement. Any changes to Support
    Tiers or associated terms will be communicated through standard notification channels, but the timing and method of
    such communications are at the sole discretion of the Service Provider.</p>

<h4>Basic Support</h4>
<p>Basic Support constitutes the foundational level of assistance provided by the Service Provider to the Customer at no
    additional cost beyond the subscription fee for the Tool_1 platform. This support tier includes access to the
    standard communication channels such as email and the support portal during the designated Support Hours, which are
    generally weekdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time. While the Service Provider endeavors to respond to all Basic
    Support inquiries promptly, there are no explicit guarantees regarding response or resolution times under this
    tier.</p>
<p>Customers utilizing Basic Support should be aware that priority is generally lower compared to Premium Support
    customers, and response times may vary based on the volume of incoming requests and the severity of reported issues.
    The Service Provider does not warrant uninterrupted or immediate support for Basic Support requests, and Customers
    acknowledge that terminology referring to “User” or “Customer” within this section may be used interchangeably
    without distinction, which could occasionally create confusion about who is entitled to submit requests under this
    tier.</p>
<p>Basic Support does not include proactive monitoring, dedicated account management, or escalation privileges.
    Furthermore, issues arising from unauthorized modifications, third-party integrations, or data inconsistencies may
    fall outside the scope of Basic Support and be subject to additional fees or require escalation to higher support
    tiers. The Service Provider reserves the right to reclassify support requests submitted under Basic Support to a
    higher tier at its sole discretion, which may result in altered response expectations without prior
    notification.</p>
<p>Lastly, while the Service Provider will make commercially reasonable efforts to resolve Basic Support issues
    efficiently, no assurances are provided regarding the resolution timeframe, and Customers should plan accordingly.
    Any references to “Customer” in this section should be interpreted broadly to include authorized Users,
    notwithstanding the lack of precise differentiation between these terms throughout the Agreement.</p>

<h4>Premium Support</h4>
<p>Premium Support provides an enhanced level of service designed to meet the needs of Customers requiring prioritized
    assistance and dedicated resources for the Tool_1 platform. This Support Tier includes all features of Basic
    Support, with the addition of expedited response times, extended availability hours beyond the standard Support
    Hours, and access to a designated support representative to facilitate issue resolution and account management.</p>
<p>Customers subscribing to Premium Support may expect initial responses to critical issues within 2 business hours and
    non-critical inquiries within 1 business day. However, these timeframes are targets and not absolute guarantees. The
    Service Provider reserves the right to modify response priorities and availability without prior notice, which could
    affect Customer expectations. Notably, while the term “Customer” is predominantly used in this section, references
    to “User” may appear interchangeably, potentially introducing confusion regarding eligibility for Premium Support
    benefits.</p>
<p>Premium Support also includes proactive monitoring services aimed at identifying potential issues before they impact
    the Customer, although the scope and frequency of such monitoring are not explicitly defined in this Agreement.
    Furthermore, Customers are entitled to periodic service reviews conducted by their designated support
    representative; however, scheduling and content of these reviews remain subject to the Service Provider’s
    discretion.</p>
<p>In the event of termination or downgrade from Premium Support to Basic Support, the Service Provider commits to
    transitioning support services within a reasonable period, though “reasonable period” is not specifically defined
    and may lead to differing interpretations. Additionally, Premium Support Customers acknowledge that while enhanced
    services are provided, resolution times remain subject to operational constraints and no binding guarantees are made
    regarding issue resolution within set timeframes.</p>

<h3>Contact Methods</h3>
<p>The Service Provider offers multiple channels through which the Customer or authorized Users may initiate contact for
    support and general inquiries concerning the Tool_1 platform. These channels include email, a dedicated support
    portal accessible via the Service dashboard, and telephone support during the designated Support Hours. Customers
    are encouraged to use the support portal for submitting detailed requests, as it allows for more efficient tracking
    and management of inquiries.</p>
<p>Email communications should be directed to the official support address provided upon subscription registration.
    While telephone support is available during Support Hours—typically 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time on
    weekdays—availability outside these hours is limited and at the Service Provider’s discretion. The Service Provider
    does not guarantee responses via telephone for issues reported outside the standard support window, and in such
    cases, Customers may be redirected to use email or the support portal instead.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms "User" and "Customer" are used interchangeably within this section; however,
    responsibility for initiating contact lies primarily with the Customer’s designated account administrator. Other
    Users under the Customer’s account may also submit requests, but the Service Provider reserves the right to require
    validation or authorization from the primary Customer contact before proceeding with certain support actions, which
    may introduce delays.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider may provide additional contact methods, such as live chat or messaging
    integrations, subject to subscription level or Support Tier. The availability and use of these channels will be
    communicated separately and may vary over time. Customers should verify the current contact options periodically, as
    changes may occur without prior notice. Any ambiguity regarding the preferred communication channel or escalation
    path should be clarified directly with the Service Provider to avoid potential delays in issue resolution.</p>

<h4>Email Support</h4>
<p>Email Support constitutes a primary method for the Customer and authorized Users to receive assistance and
    communicate issues related to the Tool_1 platform. The Service Provider will monitor the designated support email
    address during the defined Support Hours, which are weekdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time, and will endeavor
    to provide timely responses consistent with the general response time targets outlined in the Support Services
    section.</p>
<p>Support requests submitted via email should include sufficient detail to enable efficient diagnosis and resolution of
    reported issues. While the Service Provider aims to acknowledge critical emails within 4 business hours and
    non-critical inquiries within 2 business days, these are targets and do not constitute guaranteed service levels.
    The Customer acknowledges that response times may vary due to factors such as volume of requests, complexity of the
    issue, and availability of support personnel.</p>
<p>It is important to note that references to “User” and “Customer” within this section are used interchangeably without
    explicit distinction, which may lead to uncertainty regarding who is authorized to submit email requests and receive
    responses. Furthermore, the Service Provider reserves the right to request additional verification or authorization
    from the primary Customer contact before acting on certain email inquiries, which may result in delays.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Service Provider does not guarantee confidentiality or security for information transmitted via
    email, and Customers are advised to avoid sending sensitive data through this channel unless otherwise agreed upon.
    In the event of high-volume or complex issues, the Service Provider may recommend transitioning the support case to
    the support portal or telephone for more effective handling, though no obligation exists to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, email support availability outside the defined Support Hours is limited and provided solely at the Service
    Provider’s discretion. The phrase “timely manner” used in relation to email responses is intentionally vague and may
    lead to differing interpretations between the parties.</p>

<h4>Live Chat</h4>
<p>Live Chat support is offered as an additional communication channel for the Customer and authorized Users to obtain
    real-time assistance related to the Tool_1 platform. Availability of Live Chat is generally limited to the standard
    Support Hours—weekdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time—though the Service Provider may extend these hours at its
    sole discretion. The Service Provider does not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted Live Chat availability and
    reserves the right to disable or restrict access to this channel without prior notice.</p>
<p>Live Chat interactions are intended to facilitate prompt resolution of common issues and provide guidance on Service
    features. However, the Service Provider does not warrant that all inquiries submitted via Live Chat will be
    addressed immediately or resolved during the session. Complex or high-priority matters may be escalated to other
    support channels, such as email or telephone, for further investigation. The Customer acknowledges that response
    times and service levels for Live Chat are subject to operational variability and resource availability.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the terms “User” and “Customer” continue to be used interchangeably within this section,
    which may create some uncertainty concerning who is authorized to initiate Live Chat conversations. Additionally,
    the Service Provider may require verification or authorization from the primary Customer contact before proceeding
    with certain support actions initiated through Live Chat, potentially causing delays.</p>
<p>Live Chat transcripts may be recorded and retained by the Service Provider for quality assurance and training
    purposes. While the Service Provider endeavors to maintain confidentiality, the Customer should avoid sharing
    sensitive or confidential information during Live Chat sessions unless expressly agreed upon. Furthermore, Live Chat
    support availability and scope may vary according to the Customer’s Support Tier, with Premium Support customers
    potentially receiving prioritized attention; however, these distinctions are not explicitly defined within this
    Agreement, possibly leading to ambiguity.</p>
<p>Finally, the Service Provider disclaims any liability for delays or failures in Live Chat service caused by technical
    issues, network interruptions, or factors beyond its control, and the Customer agrees that Live Chat is provided as
    a supplementary support option without binding service level commitments.</p>

<h4>Phone Support</h4>
<p>Phone Support is provided as a supplementary channel for the Customer and authorized Users to receive direct verbal
    assistance regarding the Tool_1 platform during the defined Support Hours, which are generally weekdays from 9:00 AM
    to 5:00 PM local time. The Service Provider endeavors to make telephone support available during these hours;
    however, availability outside this window is limited and offered solely at the Service Provider’s discretion,
    without any guarantee of response or resolution times.</p>
<p>The Service Provider will prioritize incoming calls based on the severity of the reported issue and the Support Tier
    applicable to the Customer. While Premium Support Customers may expect expedited phone responses, the Agreement does
    not explicitly guarantee any minimum wait times or call answer rates, potentially leading to variability in service
    experience. Customers acknowledge that the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably within this section
    and the broader Agreement, which may cause some uncertainty regarding who is authorized to initiate phone support
    requests or receive communications.</p>
<p>Calls made outside of the designated Support Hours may be redirected to voicemail or an automated messaging system.
    The Service Provider will make commercially reasonable efforts to return such messages within a “reasonable period,”
    although this term is not specifically defined herein and may result in differing expectations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider reserves the right to record and monitor telephone interactions for quality
    assurance and training purposes. Customers should avoid sharing sensitive or confidential information during phone
    calls unless expressly agreed upon. The Service Provider disclaims any liability for delays, dropped calls, or
    technical difficulties that may affect the quality or availability of Phone Support, and the Customer agrees that
    telephone assistance is provided as a non-binding service option subject to operational constraints.</p>

<h2>Customer Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Customer acknowledges and agrees to fulfill certain responsibilities to ensure effective delivery and use of the
    Tool_1 platform. Primarily, the Customer must provide accurate, complete, and lawful data inputs for processing by
    the Service. The Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all access credentials and for
    restricting access to the Service to authorized Users only. Any unauthorized use or breach of security resulting
    from the Customer’s failure to safeguard such credentials shall be the sole responsibility of the Customer.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Customer shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards governing data
    privacy, intellectual property, and export controls in connection with the use of the Service. The Customer must
    ensure that all data uploaded or processed does not infringe upon third-party rights or contain prohibited content.
    The Service Provider disclaims any liability arising from Customer’s misuse or unlawful data submissions.</p>
<p>The Customer is also obligated to promptly notify the Service Provider of any suspected security incidents,
    unauthorized access, or Service anomalies that may impact the integrity or confidentiality of their data. Failure to
    provide timely notification may limit the Service Provider’s ability to respond effectively.</p>
<p>While the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, for the purposes of this
    section, the obligations primarily apply to the Customer entity or its designated administrators. However, ambiguity
    persists regarding individual User responsibilities, particularly in multi-user environments, and the Customer
    agrees to establish internal policies governing User conduct and compliance.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Customer shall ensure that all software and hardware environments used to access Tool_1 meet the minimum
    technical requirements specified by the Service Provider. The Customer acknowledges that failure to maintain such
    environments may result in degraded performance or unsupported issues, for which the Service Provider shall bear no
    responsibility.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>To ensure optimal performance and full functionality of the Tool_1 platform, the Customer is responsible for
    providing and maintaining an appropriate technical environment that meets the minimum system requirements specified
    by the Service Provider. These requirements include, but are not limited to, compatible operating systems, supported
    web browsers, sufficient network bandwidth, and hardware capable of handling AI Analytics workloads. While the
    Service Provider may publish recommended specifications, it retains the discretion to update these requirements
    without prior notice, potentially affecting the Customer’s existing infrastructure compatibility.</p>
<p>The Service Provider recommends that the Customer use the latest stable versions of major web browsers such as
    Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for accessing the Service. However, the Service Provider does not guarantee full
    functionality or security compliance when older or unsupported browser versions are used. Similarly, the Customer’s
    network environment should support secure HTTPS connections and allow necessary firewall exceptions to enable
    uninterrupted communication with the Service.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “minimum system requirements” is not exhaustively defined within this
    Agreement, and the Customer acknowledges that certain features or updates may necessitate higher specifications or
    additional software components. The Service Provider will endeavor to communicate significant changes to system
    requirements via standard notification channels; however, no explicit timelines or methods are guaranteed. This
    ambiguity may result in temporary incompatibilities or service disruptions if the Customer’s environment is not
    promptly updated to align with evolving requirements.</p>
<p>Finally, references to “User” and “Customer” in this section are used interchangeably, though the Service Provider
    considers the Customer responsible for ensuring that all authorized Users have access to the requisite systems and
    configurations. The Customer accepts that failure to comply with system requirements may lead to diminished Service
    performance or unsupported issues for which the Service Provider disclaims liability.</p>

<h3>Compliance with Terms</h3>
<p>The Customer agrees to use the Tool_1 Service strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
    Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations. Compliance includes, but is not limited to, adherence to data
    privacy laws, intellectual property rights, export controls, and any other legal requirements relevant to the
    Customer’s jurisdiction and industry. The Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the
    Service if it reasonably believes the Customer or any User has violated these terms, engaged in unlawful activities,
    or attempted to compromise the security or integrity of the Service.</p>
<p>Customers acknowledge that the responsibility for ensuring compliance primarily rests with the Customer entity,
    although the Service may be accessed by multiple authorized Users. However, the Agreement does not explicitly
    delineate the specific obligations or liabilities of individual Users versus the Customer as a whole, which may lead
    to ambiguity concerning accountability in multi-user environments. The Customer agrees to implement appropriate
    internal policies and controls to govern User conduct and ensure ongoing compliance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider may conduct periodic audits or reviews to verify compliance with this Agreement.
    Such audits may include requests for documentation or access to relevant information. The Customer agrees to
    cooperate fully with any such requests within a reasonable timeframe, though “reasonable timeframe” is not
    specifically defined herein, potentially resulting in differing expectations between the parties.</p>
<p>In the event of non-compliance, the Service Provider reserves the right to take corrective actions, including but not
    limited to issuing warnings, restricting features, or terminating the Customer’s account. Notwithstanding these
    rights, the Agreement does not specify any formal dispute resolution procedures related to compliance issues, which
    may affect the management of such incidents. The Service Provider’s decision regarding compliance enforcement shall
    be final and binding, barring any conflicting legal obligations.</p>

<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>
<p>The Customer or authorized User shall promptly report any issues, errors, or anomalies encountered while using the
    Tool_1 platform through the designated support channels as described in the Support Services section. Reports should
    include detailed descriptions of the problem, steps to reproduce the issue, relevant screenshots or logs, and any
    other information reasonably necessary to facilitate efficient diagnosis and resolution by the Service Provider’s
    support team.</p>
<p>Reports may be submitted via email, support portal, Live Chat, or telephone, subject to availability and Support Tier
    entitlements. While the terms "Customer" and "User" are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, for the
    purposes of issue reporting, the Service Provider recommends that the Customer designate a primary contact
    responsible for consolidating and submitting issues to avoid duplication or conflicting communications. However, all
    authorized Users retain the right to report issues independently, which may occasionally result in overlapping or
    redundant tickets.</p>
<p>The Service Provider will acknowledge receipt of reported issues in accordance with the response time targets
    outlined in the Support Services section. Nevertheless, acknowledgment times may vary depending on the volume and
    severity of incoming reports. The Customer understands that submission of an issue report does not guarantee
    immediate investigation or resolution, and prioritization will be determined by the Service Provider based on impact
    and severity criteria, which are not explicitly detailed herein, potentially leading to differing expectations.</p>
<p>In case of discrepancies between descriptions provided by different Users or Customers reporting the same issue, the
    Service Provider reserves the right to rely on the information furnished by the designated primary Customer contact
    for resolution purposes. This approach may lead to delays or inconsistencies if internal communication within the
    Customer’s organization is inadequate. Furthermore, the Customer acknowledges that failure to provide sufficient or
    accurate information may result in delayed resolution or closure of reported issues without remedial action.</p>

<h2>Service Level Metrics</h2>
<p>The Service Provider shall monitor and report on various Service Level Metrics to assess the performance and
    reliability of the Tool_1 platform. These metrics include uptime percentage, response times for support requests,
    and resolution times for reported issues. While the Service Provider targets a minimum uptime of 99.5% per calendar
    month, as described in prior sections, this figure is provided as an objective rather than a binding guarantee.
    Metrics related to support response and resolution times are similarly aspirational and subject to operational
    variability.</p>
<p>Measurement of uptime shall exclude Scheduled Maintenance and any Downtime attributable to Force Majeure events or
    Customer-related issues. However, the precise methodology for calculating downtime and availability may vary and is
    not exhaustively defined within this Agreement, potentially causing ambiguity in metric interpretation and
    reporting. Furthermore, the terms “User” and “Customer” are used interchangeably when referencing parties entitled
    to receive Service Level reports, which may lead to confusion regarding the designated recipient of such
    information.</p>
<p>Support response and resolution times will be tracked according to severity levels, with targets aligned to those
    outlined in the Support Services section. Nevertheless, no formal reporting frequency or format is mandated herein,
    and the Service Provider reserves discretion in determining how and when metrics are communicated to the Customer.
    The absence of standardized reporting protocols may result in inconsistent visibility into Service performance.</p>
<p>In the event that Service Level Metrics consistently fall below targeted thresholds for a period of three consecutive
    months, the Customer may request a review meeting with the Service Provider to discuss potential remedies or
    improvements. However, the Agreement does not specify any automatic escalation procedures or enforceable
    consequences tied to these metrics, leaving resolution efforts subject to mutual agreement and negotiation.</p>

<h3>Measurement Criteria</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall utilize a combination of automated monitoring tools and manual verification processes to
    measure the performance and reliability of the Tool_1 platform against the Service Level Metrics outlined in this
    Agreement. The primary criteria for measurement include system uptime, response time to support inquiries, and
    resolution time for reported issues. These measurements will be conducted on a monthly basis, with aggregated data
    used to evaluate compliance with the stated targets.</p>
<p>Uptime measurement will be based on the total minutes the Service is accessible and fully operational divided by the
    total minutes in the calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance periods and Downtime caused by Force Majeure
    events or Customer-related factors. Notwithstanding this, the Agreement does not specify a standardized method for
    recording or verifying Downtime events, which may lead to inconsistencies in reporting accuracy and interpretations
    of availability.</p>
<p>Support response and resolution times will be tracked according to the severity classification of the issue, as
    defined in the Support Services section. However, the criteria for categorizing issue severity are not exhaustively
    defined herein, potentially resulting in subjective assessments that affect measurement outcomes. Furthermore, while
    the terms “Customer” and “User” are employed interchangeably throughout this Agreement, it remains unclear whether
    performance is measured per individual User or aggregated at the Customer account level, which may affect
    accountability and reporting granularity.</p>
<p>Measurement data will be collected and stored by the Service Provider for a minimum period of six months, after which
    archival or deletion procedures will be conducted at the Service Provider’s discretion. The Customer may request
    access to historical performance data, though the Agreement does not explicitly guarantee timely provision of such
    reports, introducing potential ambiguity regarding transparency and data availability.</p>

<h3>Reporting and Monitoring</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall implement ongoing monitoring of the Tool_1 platform to ensure consistent performance and
    reliability in accordance with the Service Level Metrics outlined in this Agreement. Monitoring activities include
    automated system checks, real-time alerts for service disruptions, and periodic reviews of usage statistics to
    identify potential issues proactively. The Service Provider will endeavor to maintain transparency by providing the
    Customer with access to certain monitoring dashboards and summary reports, subject to the Customer’s subscription
    level and Support Tier.</p>
<p>Periodic reporting will be issued to the Customer, typically on a monthly basis, detailing key performance indicators
    such as uptime percentages, incident counts, and average response times. However, the frequency, format, and level
    of detail of these reports are at the sole discretion of the Service Provider and may vary over time without prior
    notice. This may lead to ambiguity regarding the extent and regularity of reporting, and the Customer is encouraged
    to request clarification if the provided information does not meet their expectations.</p>
<p>Although the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, for the purposes of
    reporting and monitoring, reports will be directed primarily to the Customer’s designated account administrator.
    Individual Users may have limited or no direct access to performance data unless explicitly authorized by the
    Customer, which may create some confusion among Users expecting visibility into Service metrics.</p>
<p>In the event that significant performance anomalies or repeated service interruptions are detected, the Service
    Provider commits to notifying the Customer within a “reasonable period” of becoming aware of the issue. However, the
    term “reasonable period” is not expressly defined herein and remains subject to interpretation, potentially
    resulting in differences in expectation between the parties. The Service Provider will use commercially reasonable
    efforts to investigate and resolve such issues promptly, but no guaranteed timelines for corrective action are
    established in this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Remedies for Non-Compliance</h2>
<p>In the event that the Service Provider fails to meet the performance standards or Service Level Metrics set forth in
    this Agreement, the Customer may notify the Service Provider in writing to seek remediation. While the Service
    Provider strives to uphold the targeted uptime and response times, no explicit financial penalties, service credits,
    or automatic remedies are guaranteed under this Agreement. Instead, the parties agree to engage in good faith
    discussions to address any identified deficiencies and explore potential improvements.</p>
<p>Should non-compliance persist for a period exceeding three consecutive months, the Customer may request a formal
    review meeting with the Service Provider to discuss root causes and corrective action plans. However, this provision
    neither mandates specific escalation procedures nor obligates the Service Provider to implement any particular
    remedy. The absence of defined remedies may result in varying interpretations as to the Customer’s recourse options
    and the Service Provider’s responsibilities.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Customer’s access
    to the Service in cases of repeated or severe breaches of the Agreement, including but not limited to violations of
    compliance obligations or misuse of the Service. Such termination shall be effective upon written notice and without
    entitlement to compensation, although the timing and conditions for reinstatement, if any, are not explicitly
    stated, potentially leading to uncertainty.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that throughout this section, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably,
    which may cause ambiguity regarding who is entitled to initiate remedies or be affected by enforcement actions. The
    Customer is encouraged to clarify internally which parties hold authority in such matters to avoid disputes or
    delays.</p>

<h3>Service Credits</h3>
<p>In recognition of the importance of reliable Service delivery, the Service Provider may, at its sole discretion,
    offer Service Credits to the Customer in instances where the Service fails to meet the targeted uptime of 99.5% in
    any given calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Downtime caused by Force Majeure events or
    Customer-related issues. Service Credits, if granted, shall be calculated as a percentage of the monthly
    subscription fees paid by the Customer corresponding to the affected Service period.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not establish a binding entitlement to Service Credits, nor does it
    specify the precise calculation methodology or maximum credit amounts. The absence of definitive criteria for
    eligibility may lead to ambiguity concerning when and how Service Credits are applied. Furthermore, the terms
    “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably in this section without clarification as to which party may request
    or receive Service Credits, potentially causing confusion in multi-user accounts.</p>
<p>To request a Service Credit, the Customer must submit a written claim within thirty (30) days following the end of
    the month in which the alleged Service disruption occurred. Claims submitted after this period may be declined at
    the Service Provider’s discretion. The Service Provider will review the claim and notify the Customer of the outcome
    within a reasonable timeframe; however, the term “reasonable timeframe” is not explicitly defined and may result in
    differing expectations between the parties.</p>
<p>Service Credits shall be applied solely as a credit toward future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash or
    any other form of compensation. The issuance of Service Credits shall constitute the Customer’s exclusive remedy for
    any failure by the Service Provider to meet the Service Level Metrics. Additionally, the Service Provider reserves
    the right to deny Service Credits if the disruption was caused or contributed to by the Customer’s actions or
    omissions. This provision may conflict with earlier sections suggesting immediate data deletion upon termination, as
    such conflicts create uncertainty about post-termination remedies.</p>

<h3>Claim Process</h3>
<p>To initiate a claim related to Service Level non-compliance or request Service Credits, the Customer must submit a
    formal written notice to the Service Provider within thirty (30) calendar days following the conclusion of the month
    during which the alleged Service deficiency occurred. Claims should be directed to the designated support email or
    submitted via the support portal, accompanied by sufficient documentation detailing the nature of the incident,
    including dates, times, and any relevant logs or evidence supporting the claim.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a claim, the Service Provider will acknowledge the submission within a reasonable timeframe,
    typically not exceeding ten (10) business days; however, the term “reasonable timeframe” is not expressly defined
    and may be subject to interpretation. The Service Provider will then conduct an investigation to verify the claim’s
    validity, which may involve reviewing system performance data, uptime records, and related metrics.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the Agreement refers to the party submitting claims as the “Customer,” references
    elsewhere occasionally use the term “User” without clear distinction. This inconsistent terminology could lead to
    confusion regarding who is authorized to file claims, especially in cases where multiple Users exist under a single
    Customer account. For clarity, claims should ideally be submitted by the Customer’s primary account administrator to
    ensure proper processing.</p>
<p>Following the investigation, the Service Provider will notify the Customer of the determination and any applicable
    remedies, including the issuance of Service Credits if eligible. The timeframe for this notification is at the
    Service Provider’s sole discretion and may vary based on claim complexity. The Customer acknowledges that acceptance
    of any Service Credit shall constitute full settlement of the claim, and no further compensation shall be due.</p>
<p>Claims submitted after the specified 30-day period may be rejected at the Service Provider’s discretion.
    Additionally, the Service Provider reserves the right to deny claims if it determines that the Service disruption
    was caused, in whole or in part, by the Customer’s actions, omissions, or failure to comply with the terms of this
    Agreement.</p>

<h3>Exclusions</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance of its obligations under this
    Agreement to the extent such failure or delay results from causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not
    limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, governmental actions, or failures of
    third-party service providers. Such events are collectively referred to as Force Majeure events and shall excuse the
    Service Provider from performance during the duration of the event.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Service Provider expressly excludes liability for any Service disruptions or degradations caused by
    Customer actions or omissions, including but not limited to misuse of the Service, unauthorized modifications,
    failure to comply with system requirements, or violations of applicable laws and regulations. The Customer
    acknowledges responsibility for ensuring that all Users adhere to these obligations and that any unauthorized use or
    negligence by Users may result in exclusion of remedies under this Agreement.</p>
<p>It is further clarified that the Service Provider shall not be responsible for any indirect, incidental,
    consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use or inability to use the Service, regardless of whether such
    damages were foreseeable. The Agreement does not provide warranties of uninterrupted or error-free Service
    operation, and the Service Provider disclaims any implied warranties to that effect.</p>
<p>While the terms “Customer” and “User” are generally used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, for the purposes
    of this section, the Service Provider’s exclusions primarily apply to the Customer as the subscribing entity.
    However, ambiguity remains concerning the extent to which individual Users may be held accountable for excluded
    circumstances, particularly in multi-user environments, and the Customer agrees to address such responsibilities
    internally.</p>
<p>Lastly, any exclusions related to data retention and deletion policies should be interpreted in conjunction with the
    conflicting provisions elsewhere in this Agreement regarding immediate versus extended data retention periods, which
    may create uncertainty about the Service Provider’s obligations post-termination.</p>

<h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
<p>The Service Provider’s liability arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, negligence,
    or otherwise, shall be limited to direct damages and shall not exceed the amount of fees paid by the Customer for
    the Service during the twelve (12) month period preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Under no circumstances
    shall the Service Provider be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary
    damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities, even if advised of
    the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges that the inherent nature of AI Analytics services involves complexities and occasional
    inaccuracies; therefore, the Service Provider does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the insights or
    predictions generated by Tool_1. The Customer agrees to use the Service at its own risk and remains responsible for
    any decisions made based on the Service outputs.</p>
<p>Liability exclusions and limitations set forth herein apply equally to all claims brought by either the Customer or
    any User of the Service, though the Agreement inconsistently alternates between these terms without clear
    distinction, which may lead to uncertainty regarding applicable parties. Furthermore, the Service Provider’s total
    liability shall not extend to any claims arising from Customer’s failure to comply with its obligations under this
    Agreement, including but not limited to improper data submission or breach of system requirements.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit liability for death or personal injury caused by
    the Service Provider’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Customer acknowledges that the limitations
    described herein represent a reasonable allocation of risk between the parties, considering the nature of the
    Service and the fees charged.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure</h3>
<p>Neither the Service Provider nor the Customer shall be held liable for any failure or delay in performing their
    respective obligations under this Agreement if such failure or delay is caused by events beyond their reasonable
    control, commonly referred to as Force Majeure events. These events include, but are not limited to, natural
    disasters, acts of government, war, terrorism, labor strikes, pandemics, power outages, cyber-attacks, or failures
    of third-party service providers essential to the operation of the Tool_1 platform.</p>
<p>In the occurrence of a Force Majeure event, the affected party shall promptly notify the other party in writing
    within a reasonable timeframe, though this term is not explicitly defined herein, which may lead to differing
    interpretations regarding the timing and adequacy of such notification. The obligations of the affected party shall
    be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure event, and the time for performance shall be extended
    accordingly. However, if the Force Majeure event persists for a period exceeding thirty (30) days, either party may
    terminate the Agreement upon written notice without penalty.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that while the term “Customer” is predominantly used throughout this Agreement, references to
    “User” in this section should be interpreted to include all authorized individuals accessing the Service under the
    Customer’s account. This interchangeable terminology may create ambiguity concerning which parties are entitled to
    relief under Force Majeure provisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider shall make commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of Force Majeure
    events on the availability and performance of the Service; however, no guarantees or warranties are made regarding
    the restoration timeframe or the extent of service disruption. The Customer agrees that such events do not
    constitute a breach of this Agreement and waives any claims for damages arising directly or indirectly from Force
    Majeure occurrences.</p>

<h3>Indirect Damages</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary
    damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of business,
    loss of data, or loss of goodwill, even if the Service Provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    This exclusion applies regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, or
    otherwise.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider’s limitation on indirect damages does not affect any liability
    that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law, such as liability for death or personal injury caused by
    the Service Provider’s negligence. The Customer acknowledges that the Tool_1 Service is provided "as is," and the
    nature of AI-generated insights inherently involves an element of unpredictability, which may contribute to
    unexpected indirect impacts.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that, while the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably throughout this
    Agreement, for the purposes of liability provisions in this section, the term “User” may be interpreted more
    narrowly to refer only to individual end-users rather than the subscribing entity. This inconsistent terminology may
    introduce ambiguity regarding which parties are subject to the indemnity and limitation clauses herein.</p>
<p>Moreover, any indirect damages arising from delays, inaccuracies, or interruptions in Service delivery shall be
    deemed consequential and are expressly excluded from the Service Provider’s liability, notwithstanding any
    conflicting statements in other sections suggesting remedies or credits may be available. The Customer agrees that
    reliance on the Tool_1 platform’s analytics is at their own risk, and the Service Provider disclaims any
    responsibility for decisions made based on such data.</p>

<h2>Term and Termination</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue in full force and effect until terminated by either
    party as provided herein. The initial term shall remain effective indefinitely unless terminated in accordance with
    the provisions set forth below. Either the Service Provider or the Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time
    by providing written notice to the other party. The notice period for termination by the Customer is thirty (30)
    calendar days, whereas the Service Provider may terminate immediately under certain circumstances, including but not
    limited to breach of this Agreement or non-payment of fees.</p>
<p>Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either party of obligations incurred prior to the effective date of
    termination. Upon termination, the Service Provider shall deactivate the Customer’s access to the Tool_1 platform
    and may, subject to the conflicting data retention provisions elsewhere in this Agreement, either delete or retain
    Customer data in accordance with its data retention policy. The ambiguity surrounding data deletion versus retention
    may lead to differing expectations regarding post-termination data handling.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate access without prior
    notice if the Customer or any User is suspected of violating the terms of this Agreement, engaging in unlawful
    conduct, or compromising the security or integrity of the Service. The terms “Customer” and “User” are used
    interchangeably in this section without explicit differentiation, which may cause uncertainty regarding the scope of
    termination rights as applied to individual Users versus the subscribing entity.</p>
<p>Upon termination, the Customer is responsible for exporting or backing up any data or content stored in the Service
    prior to the termination date. The Service Provider shall have no obligation to retain or provide access to such
    data beyond the termination date except as required by applicable law or as otherwise specified in this Agreement.
    Any provisions related to fees, indemnification, confidentiality, and limitations of liability shall survive
    termination.</p>

<h3>Agreement Duration</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall become effective on the date the Customer first subscribes to the Tool_1 Service ("Effective
    Date") and shall continue in effect until terminated in accordance with the terms set forth herein. Unless otherwise
    specified, the Agreement will automatically renew on a month-to-month basis following the initial subscription
    period, subject to the Customer’s continued payment of applicable fees.</p>
<p>Either party may terminate the Agreement by providing written notice to the other party as detailed in the Term and
    Termination section. The notice period required for termination by the Customer is thirty (30) calendar days,
    whereas the Service Provider may, at its sole discretion, terminate the Agreement immediately for cause, including
    but not limited to breach of contract or non-payment. Notably, the Agreement does not clearly define whether the
    automatic renewal applies to annual or monthly subscription plans, creating ambiguity regarding the precise duration
    of successive terms.</p>
<p>During the term of this Agreement, the Service Provider reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions,
    including pricing, support levels, and Service features, with prior notice to the Customer. Such modifications shall
    become effective on the next billing cycle unless otherwise agreed. The Customer’s continued use of the Service
    after the effective date of any modifications shall constitute acceptance of the revised terms. The interchangeable
    use of the terms “User” and “Customer” throughout this section may cause confusion regarding which party holds
    responsibility for accepting amendments or initiating termination.</p>
<p>In addition, if the Agreement is terminated, all rights granted to the Customer or User under this Agreement shall
    immediately cease, except for any provisions expressly stated to survive termination. The ambiguity in the use of
    terminology between “User” and “Customer” may lead to differing interpretations about which individuals retain
    rights or obligations post-termination, especially in multi-user accounts.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions outlined in the Term and Termination
    section. Termination by the Customer requires a written notice at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the
    intended termination date. Conversely, the Service Provider reserves the right to terminate the Agreement
    immediately under certain conditions, including but not limited to material breach, non-payment, or suspected misuse
    of the Service.</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing, either party may terminate the Agreement if the other party becomes insolvent, files
    for bankruptcy, or undergoes a similar financial distress event. Termination under such circumstances shall be
    effective immediately upon written notice to the affected party.</p>
<p>The Service Provider may also suspend or terminate access to the Service upon reasonable suspicion that the Customer
    or any User is engaging in activities detrimental to the Service’s security, functionality, or reputation. However,
    the Agreement does not clearly define the criteria for such suspicions or the process for resolving disputes arising
    from termination on these grounds, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding the rights and recourse available to
    the affected party.</p>
<p>Upon termination, the Service Provider shall deactivate access to the Tool_1 platform and, subject to the conflicting
    data retention policies described elsewhere in this Agreement, may delete or retain Customer data. The lack of
    clarity in data handling post-termination may result in differing expectations or disputes over data
    availability.</p>
<p>It is important to note that references to “Customer” and “User” continue to be used interchangeably in this section
    without explicit differentiation, which may cause confusion about which parties are directly impacted by termination
    actions or notices. The Customer remains responsible for ensuring that all authorized Users comply with termination
    obligations and internal policies.</p>

<h3>Renewal Terms</h3>
<p>Upon expiration of the initial subscription period, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive terms of
    one month each, unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior
    to the end of the then-current term. The exact duration of renewal terms may vary depending on the subscription plan
    selected by the Customer, though this Agreement primarily references monthly renewals without explicitly addressing
    annual or multi-year plans, which may create uncertainty regarding renewal intervals for Customers on longer-term
    contracts.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to adjust subscription fees, Service features, or Support Tiers upon renewal,
    provided that the Customer is given prior notice at least thirty (30) calendar days before the renewal date.
    Continued use of the Service beyond the renewal date shall constitute acceptance of any such modifications. However,
    the Agreement does not clearly specify the method or form of such notices, leading to potential ambiguity about how
    Customers will be informed.</p>
<p>Customers wishing to terminate or modify their subscription prior to renewal must comply with the termination notice
    requirements set forth in the Term and Termination section. Failure to provide timely notice will result in
    automatic renewal under the prevailing terms. It is important to note that references to “User” and “Customer”
    within this section are used interchangeably without clear definition, which may cause confusion regarding which
    party holds the authority to initiate renewal decisions or termination notifications.</p>
<p>In the event of any changes to renewal terms, including pricing or service scope, the Service Provider encourages
    Customers to review their subscription details carefully and contact the Service Provider promptly to address any
    concerns. Notwithstanding the above, the Service Provider does not guarantee that renewal terms will remain
    consistent across successive periods, and such variability may affect budgeting and planning for the Customer.</p>

<h2>Amendments and Updates</h2>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to amend or update the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
    modifications to Service features, pricing structures, Support Tiers, and operational policies, at any time during
    the term of this Agreement. Such amendments shall be communicated to the Customer through reasonable means,
    including email notifications, dashboard alerts, or postings on the Service Provider’s official website. The
    Customer’s continued use of Tool_1 following any such notice constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not explicitly define the minimum notice period required for
    amendments, which may lead to ambiguity regarding how much time the Customer has to review and respond to changes
    before they become effective. In certain circumstances, updates may be implemented with limited or no prior
    notification if deemed necessary by the Service Provider to address security vulnerabilities, legal compliance, or
    critical operational issues.</p>
<p>Any amendments that materially alter the scope or functionality of the Service will be accompanied by an effort to
    provide advance notice; however, the threshold for what constitutes a material change is not clearly delineated
    herein, potentially resulting in differing interpretations between the parties. The terms “Customer” and “User”
    continue to be used interchangeably throughout this section, which may lead to uncertainty about which party is
    responsible for reviewing and consenting to updates, especially in organizations with multiple authorized Users.</p>
<p>The Customer is encouraged to regularly review the Agreement and any related communications to stay informed of
    changes. Should the Customer object to any amendment, they may terminate the Agreement in accordance with the Term
    and Termination provisions. Failure to provide timely notice of termination after receiving updated terms may be
    construed as acceptance of the amendments.</p>

<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall endeavor to notify the Customer of any material changes to this Agreement, including
    modifications to Service features, pricing, Support Tiers, or operational policies, through reasonable communication
    channels such as email, dashboard alerts, or postings on the Service Provider’s official website. Such notifications
    will generally be provided at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of the changes to allow
    the Customer sufficient time to review and respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where immediate action is necessary—such as to address security
    vulnerabilities, comply with legal obligations, or mitigate critical operational risks—the Service Provider reserves
    the right to implement changes with shorter notice periods or without prior notice. The Customer acknowledges that
    such circumstances may arise and agrees that the Service Provider’s decision in these matters shall be final.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider strives to ensure clear and timely communication, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used
    interchangeably within this section, which may lead to ambiguity regarding which parties are entitled to receive
    notifications or are responsible for acknowledging changes. It is the Customer’s responsibility to disseminate
    information appropriately to all authorized Users within its organization.</p>
<p>Failure by the Customer or any User to receive or review such notifications shall not exempt the Customer from
    compliance with the amended terms. Continued use of the Service after the effective date of any changes shall
    constitute acceptance of the modifications. The Customer may elect to terminate the Agreement if it objects to any
    changes, subject to the termination provisions set forth herein. However, the Agreement does not explicitly specify
    the method or timeframe within which termination notice must be provided in response to amendments, potentially
    resulting in differing interpretations.</p>

<h3>Customer Consent</h3>
<p>By subscribing to and utilizing the Tool_1 Service, the Customer hereby provides express consent to the collection,
    processing, and storage of data in accordance with the terms outlined in this Agreement. This consent extends to all
    data inputs, usage metrics, and any derivative analytics generated through the Service. The Customer acknowledges
    that such data may be used by the Service Provider to improve platform functionality, develop new features, and
    conduct internal research, subject to applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p>The Customer further consents to the Service Provider implementing necessary updates, maintenance activities, and
    modifications to the Service, including those that may affect data handling or processing methods. While the Service
    Provider will endeavor to notify the Customer of material changes impacting data usage, the timing and scope of such
    notifications are at the sole discretion of the Service Provider, which may result in limited advance notice in
    certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not explicitly require the Service Provider to obtain renewed
    consent for each modification to data practices or Service features, potentially leading to ambiguity regarding the
    Customer’s rights to object or withdraw consent. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that all authorized Users
    under its account are informed of and comply with the data usage terms specified herein.</p>
<p>Moreover, the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement without clear
    distinction in this section, which may cause uncertainty in scenarios where individual Users may need to provide
    separate consent or have differing levels of data access and control. The Customer acknowledges that it bears the
    responsibility to manage such internal consent arrangements and agrees to indemnify the Service Provider against any
    claims arising from failure to do so.</p>
<p>By continuing to access or use the Service after any updates to this Agreement or its data handling practices, the
    Customer and its Users are deemed to have accepted those changes and reaffirmed their consent, unless termination is
    effected in accordance with the Term and Termination provisions described herein.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    Service Provider is incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The Customer agrees to submit to
    the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that jurisdiction for the resolution of any disputes arising
    out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Tool_1 Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service
    Provider reserves the right to initiate proceedings in any other jurisdiction to enforce its rights or seek
    injunctive relief.</p>
<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising between the parties relating to this Agreement
    ("Dispute"), the parties shall first attempt to resolve the matter amicably through good faith negotiations within a
    reasonable period. Should these negotiations fail to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days, either
    party may pursue mediation or arbitration as a next step, subject to mutual agreement. However, this Agreement does
    not explicitly specify the location, governing rules, or binding nature of such alternative dispute resolution
    procedures, which may lead to ambiguity regarding enforceability and procedural fairness.</p>
<p>In cases where mediation or arbitration is not mutually agreed upon or fails to resolve the Dispute, either party may
    seek relief through the courts as specified above. The Customer acknowledges that the terms "User" and "Customer"
    are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, but for the purposes of dispute resolution, only the
    Customer—the subscribing entity—shall be entitled to initiate or be subject to legal proceedings. This inconsistent
    terminology may cause uncertainty in multi-user scenarios regarding who holds standing in disputes.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to dispute resolution unless otherwise ordered by the
    adjudicating forum. The parties agree to keep all dispute-related communications confidential, except as required by
    law or necessary to enforce any resulting judgment or award. Nothing in this section shall preclude either party
    from seeking injunctive or equitable relief to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary
    information.</p>

<h3>Applicable Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The jurisdiction applicable to this Agreement and any related legal matters shall be primarily determined by the
    location in which the Service Provider is incorporated. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Customer
    agrees that all claims, disputes, or legal proceedings arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be
    subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider reserves the right to initiate legal actions or seek injunctive
    relief in alternative jurisdictions where it maintains business operations or assets. This may include, but is not
    limited to, jurisdictions where the Customer or its authorized Users are located. Such flexibility is intended to
    protect the Service Provider’s interests but may result in some uncertainty for the Customer regarding the
    appropriate forum for dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Agreement inconsistently refers to the “Customer” and “User” in contexts related to jurisdiction and
    legal standing. While the term “Customer” is generally understood to mean the subscribing entity, references to
    “User” in this section may create ambiguity about the rights and obligations of individual Users in legal
    proceedings. The Customer acknowledges responsibility for clarifying such roles internally and agrees that the
    Service Provider shall not be liable for any confusion arising from this inconsistent terminology.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between the jurisdictional provisions set forth herein and those contained in other
    sections of this Agreement, the terms of this section shall prevail unless otherwise explicitly agreed in writing by
    both parties. This provision is intended to provide clarity but may appear to contradict earlier clauses regarding
    dispute resolution locations, thereby necessitating careful review by the parties.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
<p>In the event that the parties agree to resolve any Dispute through arbitration as outlined in the Governing Law and
    Dispute Resolution section, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules mutually agreed upon by
    the Customer and the Service Provider. Absent mutual agreement, the arbitration shall proceed under the rules of a
    recognized arbitration institution selected by the Service Provider. The place of arbitration shall be the
    jurisdiction where the Service Provider is incorporated, unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator with expertise in commercial and technology-related
    disputes. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on both parties, and judgment upon the award rendered
    by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs and
    expenses related to the arbitration unless the arbitrator decides otherwise.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement does not specify the procedures for selecting the arbitrator or the
    timeline within which the arbitration must commence, which may lead to ambiguity and potential delays. Additionally,
    while the term “Customer” is predominantly used in this section, references to “User” may appear inconsistently,
    creating uncertainty as to whether individual Users have standing to participate in arbitration proceedings or if
    such rights are reserved solely for the subscribing Customer entity.</p>
<p>Claims submitted to arbitration must be initiated within the same thirty (30) day period following the Dispute as
    specified for claims under the Claim Process section, though this timeframe is not clearly synchronized with other
    notification requirements, potentially causing confusion regarding deadlines. The parties agree to act in good faith
    to resolve any procedural uncertainties and to cooperate fully in facilitating a fair and efficient arbitration
    process.</p>
