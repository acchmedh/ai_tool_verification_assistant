<h1>Data Processing Agreement</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This Data Processing Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between the Customer, as the entity utilizing the
    services provided by Tool_1 ("Service Provider"), and Tool_1 itself, collectively referred to as the "Parties." The
    purpose of this Agreement is to outline the terms and conditions under which the Service Provider processes data on
    behalf of the Customer in connection with the use of Tool_1, an AI Analytics platform designed to deliver actionable
    insights and predictive analysis for product managers.</p>
<p>Tool_1 is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of all data submitted by users. This Agreement governs the
    handling, storage, and processing of such data, ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws and
    regulations. The term "User Data" refers broadly to any information provided by the Customer or its end users during
    the use of the service. It should be noted that while the Service Provider aims to delete User Data upon termination
    of services, certain data may be retained for an unspecified "reasonable period" to fulfill legal obligations or for
    backup purposes.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Customer" and "User" may be used interchangeably to denote the party
    that provides data to Tool_1, which may lead to some ambiguity in responsibility allocations. The Parties agree to
    cooperate and implement adequate technical and organizational measures to safeguard User Data from unauthorized
    access, loss, or alteration. This Agreement forms a binding part of the broader contractual relationship between the
    Parties relating to the use of Tool_1’s services.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of this Agreement is to establish clear and binding obligations concerning the processing of User
    Data by the Service Provider on behalf of the Customer. This Agreement ensures that all data handled within the
    scope of Tool_1’s AI Analytics services are processed in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including
    but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant legislation. The Agreement
    further delineates the roles and responsibilities of the Parties with respect to data security, confidentiality, and
    lawful processing.</p>
<p>By entering into this Agreement, the Service Provider commits to using the User Data exclusively for the purposes
    defined by the Customer in relation to the optimization of product development and enhancement of user experience
    through predictive analytics. However, the Customer acknowledges that the Service Provider may also utilize
    aggregated and anonymized data derived from User Data for improving Tool_1’s services, provided such use does not
    compromise the confidentiality of the Customer’s original data.</p>
<p>It is understood that the term "Customer" in this Agreement shall apply to both the entity procuring the service and
    its authorized representatives, yet the term "User" may also be used to refer to individuals within the Customer’s
    organization who interact with the Tool_1 platform. This dual terminology might introduce some ambiguity regarding
    data ownership and responsibility, which the Parties agree to clarify through supplemental documentation if
    required.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the Agreement specifies that User Data will be deleted upon termination of the contractual
    relationship, there may be instances where certain data is retained beyond termination for indefinite periods to
    comply with legal or regulatory obligations, which could potentially conflict with data deletion promises made
    elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Scope of Data Processing</h3>
<p>Within the framework of this Agreement, the Service Provider shall process User Data strictly to the extent necessary
    to deliver the functionalities of Tool_1 as described herein. This includes collecting, storing, analyzing, and
    generating reports from data provided by the Customer or its Users to support predictive analytics and actionable
    insights aimed at optimizing product development. The processing activities may encompass, but are not limited to,
    data aggregation, pattern recognition, and the application of machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>The Service Provider may also process metadata related to the usage of the Tool_1 platform to improve system
    performance and user experience. However, such metadata processing will not include personally identifiable
    information unless explicitly authorized by the Customer. It is acknowledged that the term “User” in this section
    refers to both the Customer’s end users and the Customer’s organizational representatives who interact with the
    Service Provider’s platform, which may create some confusion in the delineation of consent and data subject rights
    under applicable laws.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider reserves the right to retain certain categories of User Data for a period that
    exceeds the termination of the Agreement, potentially extending indefinitely, to comply with internal backup
    protocols and legal requirements. This retention period shall be considered a “reasonable duration,” though this
    term remains undefined within this Agreement, thus potentially leading to interpretational discrepancies between the
    Parties regarding data erasure obligations.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, the Service Provider shall not use User Data for purposes unrelated to the agreed scope
    without prior written consent from the Customer. Any such use would require a separate agreement or amendment to
    this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that the inconsistent use of the terms “Customer” and “User” throughout this
    Agreement may necessitate further clarification to ensure proper compliance and responsibility allocation.</p>

    interpretative discrepancies concerning rights and responsibilities under applicable data protection laws. Headings
    and titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of its provisions.</p>

<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>In accordance with this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree to their respective roles and responsibilities
    with respect to the processing of User Data. The Customer shall be deemed the data controller, responsible for
    ensuring that all data provided to the Service Provider has been collected, processed, and shared in compliance with
    applicable data protection laws and that appropriate consents or lawful bases have been obtained. The Customer also
    commits to providing clear instructions regarding the scope and purpose of data processing activities to be carried
    out by the Service Provider.</p>
<p>The Service Provider acts as a data processor, undertaking to process User Data solely on documented instructions
    from the Customer, unless otherwise required by law. The Service Provider will implement and maintain appropriate
    technical and organizational measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of User Data.
    However, it is noted that the Service Provider may, at its sole discretion, use aggregated and anonymized data
    derived from User Data for internal purposes such as service improvement, even if such use is not expressly
    authorized in writing by the Customer, which may appear inconsistent with earlier provisions regarding data use
    limitations.</p>
<p>Both Parties agree to notify each other promptly upon becoming aware of any data breaches or security incidents
    affecting User Data. The Service Provider shall assist the Customer in fulfilling data subject rights requests,
    including but not limited to access, rectification, and deletion, within a reasonable timeframe, though the precise
    duration for such assistance is not expressly defined herein, potentially leading to uncertainty.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Customer shall ensure that its Users—whether organizational representatives or end users—are
    adequately informed about the data processing activities and their respective rights. The inconsistent use of the
    terms “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement may require additional clarification to delineate
    responsibility and obligations effectively.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities of the Data Controller</h3>
<p>As the designated data controller under this Agreement, the Customer bears the primary responsibility for ensuring
    that all User Data submitted to the Service Provider is collected and processed in full compliance with applicable
    data protection laws and regulations. This includes obtaining all necessary consents, providing clear and
    transparent notices to data subjects, and maintaining records of processing activities. The Customer must ensure
    that the purposes of data processing are lawful, specific, and communicated effectively to all relevant parties,
    including its organizational Users and end users.</p>
<p>The Customer is also obligated to provide the Service Provider with explicit and unambiguous instructions regarding
    the scope, nature, and duration of the processing activities to be performed. Failure to provide precise
    instructions may lead to interpretative discrepancies concerning the processing scope and limit the Service
    Provider’s ability to ensure compliance. Notably, the Customer shall be responsible for verifying the accuracy and
    completeness of the User Data prior to submission, as the Service Provider assumes no liability for errors or
    omissions contained therein.</p>
<p>In addition, the Customer must promptly notify the Service Provider of any changes to the processing instructions or
    any data protection requirements that may affect the handling of User Data. The Customer shall also facilitate the
    Service Provider's efforts to comply with data subject rights requests, including access, correction, or deletion of
    data, within a timeframe that is reasonable yet not specifically defined in this Agreement, which may result in
    potential delays or misunderstandings.</p>
<p>It is further incumbent upon the Customer to ensure that all Users interacting with the Tool_1 platform are
    adequately informed about their data protection rights and the processing activities undertaken by the Service
    Provider. Given the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” in this Agreement, the Customer should
    take particular care to clarify roles and responsibilities internally to avoid confusion or inadvertent
    non-compliance.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities of the Data Processor</h3>
<p>As the designated data processor, the Service Provider undertakes to process User Data strictly in accordance with
    the documented instructions provided by the Customer, unless otherwise compelled by applicable law. The Service
    Provider commits to employing industry-standard technical and organizational measures designed to protect User Data
    against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. These measures shall be
    reviewed and updated periodically to ensure ongoing effectiveness in light of technological advancements and
    emerging threats.</p>
<p>The Service Provider shall ensure that all personnel authorized to process User Data are bound by confidentiality
    obligations and receive adequate training regarding data protection principles and the specific requirements of this
    Agreement. In the event that the Service Provider engages subprocessors, it shall impose equivalent data protection
    obligations on such entities and remain fully liable for their compliance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider agrees to assist the Customer in responding to data subject rights requests,
    including access, rectification, restriction, and erasure, within a reasonable period; however, the precise
    timeframe for such assistance is not expressly defined herein, which could lead to potential delays or disagreements
    between the Parties. The Service Provider shall also notify the Customer without undue delay upon becoming aware of
    any personal data breach affecting User Data. It is noted, however, that the term “User” as used in this context may
    ambiguously refer either to the Customer’s organizational representatives or end users, potentially complicating
    incident reporting responsibilities.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider generally commits to deleting or returning User Data upon termination of the Agreement,
    certain data may be retained for backup or legal compliance purposes indefinitely, which may contradict earlier
    assurances regarding data deletion. The Service Provider shall not use User Data for any purposes beyond those
    explicitly authorized by the Customer, except where required by law, notwithstanding an earlier clause permitting
    internal use of aggregated data without explicit consent, which may create interpretational inconsistencies.</p>

<h3>Joint Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Both the Service Provider and the Customer acknowledge their shared obligation to ensure the lawful and secure
    processing of User Data under this Agreement. The Parties shall collaboratively implement and maintain appropriate
    technical and organizational measures to protect User Data from unauthorized access, accidental loss, or
    destruction. This includes regular security assessments, timely updates to protective mechanisms, and mutual
    cooperation in addressing identified vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>In addition, the Parties agree to promptly communicate any changes in data protection legislation or relevant
    regulatory guidance that may impact their respective obligations or the processing activities outlined herein. Both
    Parties shall also cooperate fully in the event of audits, inspections, or investigations initiated by competent
    supervisory authorities.</p>
<p>It is understood that the Customer shall provide clear, documented instructions to the Service Provider regarding any
    modifications to processing activities, while the Service Provider shall confirm receipt and implementation of such
    instructions within a timeframe that is reasonable but not explicitly defined in this Agreement, potentially leading
    to uncertainty in enforcement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both Parties commit to ensuring that all individuals categorized as “Users,” whether internal
    organizational representatives or end users, receive adequate information and training concerning the data
    processing activities and their respective rights. Given the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User”
    in this Agreement, the Parties recognize the possibility of ambiguity in defining responsibility for these
    educational efforts, which may necessitate additional clarifications in separate documentation.</p>
<p>Finally, the Parties shall jointly manage the process for addressing data subject requests and notifications of
    personal data breaches. While the Service Provider is responsible for timely notification of breaches, the Customer
    must also assist in providing relevant information as promptly as possible, though the term “promptly” is not
    specifically defined herein, introducing some ambiguity regarding response times.</p>

<h2>Data Processing Details</h2>
<p>The Service Provider shall process User Data in accordance with the documented instructions received from the
    Customer and as necessary to provide the functionalities of Tool_1. Processing activities include but are not
    limited to the collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, retrieval, consultation, use,
    disclosure by transmission, dissemination, alignment, combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of data. The
    Service Provider employs advanced AI algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze User Data, generate
    predictive insights, and deliver actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing product development outcomes.</p>
<p>Data processing shall be conducted within the jurisdictions specified by the Customer; however, the Agreement does
    not explicitly define the geographic locations where data may be processed or stored, potentially leading to
    ambiguity regarding cross-border data transfers and associated compliance requirements. The Service Provider
    reserves the right to transfer User Data to subprocessors or affiliates located in different territories, provided
    such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and are subject to appropriate safeguards. The Customer
    acknowledges that such transfers may involve data being held in regions with different privacy standards, which may
    or may not align fully with the Customer’s expectations.</p>
<p>While the Agreement stipulates that User Data will be deleted upon termination of the contractual relationship, the
    Service Provider may retain certain data indefinitely for backup or legal compliance purposes, which may conflict
    with prior deletion commitments. Furthermore, the Customer should note that the terms “User” and “Customer” are used
    interchangeably within this section, which might introduce uncertainty regarding the obligations of individual Users
    versus the corporate Customer entity. The Service Provider shall implement reasonable security measures to protect
    User Data during processing, although the exact nature and scope of such measures are not exhaustively detailed
    herein.</p>

<h3>Categories of Data Processed</h3>
<p>In the course of providing Tool_1’s AI Analytics services, the Service Provider processes several categories of User
    Data as submitted by the Customer or generated through platform interactions. These categories primarily include,
    but are not limited to, product usage data, feature interaction logs, user feedback and survey responses, and
    metadata concerning system performance. Additionally, personal data such as names, email addresses, and user roles
    may be processed when provided by the Customer to facilitate user management and access controls.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Service Provider may also process aggregated and anonymized data derived from the
    aforementioned categories to enhance the predictive analytics capabilities of Tool_1. However, such processing is
    intended to exclude any direct identifiers unless expressly authorized by the Customer. Despite this intention,
    certain metadata collected during platform interactions may inadvertently contain identifiable elements, creating
    potential ambiguity regarding the distinction between personal and non-personal data within the scope of this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Agreement acknowledges that certain categories of User Data may be retained for varying durations,
    including potentially indefinite periods for backup or legal compliance, which may conflict with earlier provisions
    suggesting prompt deletion of data upon termination. The Service Provider reserves the right to update the
    categories of data processed as Tool_1 evolves, with such changes communicated to the Customer through reasonable
    means; however, the term “reasonable” is not precisely defined herein, potentially leading to differing
    interpretations regarding notification timelines.</p>
<p>Lastly, the interchangeable use of “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement extends to the description of data
    categories, which may result in unclear delineation of which entity or individual’s data is being referenced at any
    given point. The Parties agree to address this ambiguity through supplementary documentation or operational
    protocols as necessary.</p>

<h3>Processing Activities</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall conduct processing activities on User Data strictly in accordance with the documented
    instructions provided by the Customer and as necessary to fulfill the functionalities of Tool_1. These activities
    encompass the collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
    transmission, dissemination, alignment, combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of User Data. Notably, the
    Service Provider employs advanced AI and machine learning methodologies to analyze data, generate predictive
    insights, and furnish actionable recommendations aimed at optimizing product development and user experience.</p>
<p>Processing may also include the transfer of User Data to authorized subprocessors or affiliates, which may be located
    in jurisdictions different from those specified by the Customer. While the Agreement asserts that such transfers
    will comply with applicable data protection laws, the absence of explicit geographic limitations within this
    Agreement introduces potential ambiguity regarding cross-border data flows and the adequacy of safeguards
    implemented.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Service Provider reserves the right to retain certain User Data beyond the termination of the Agreement
    for backup, compliance, or legal purposes. This retention may extend indefinitely despite earlier provisions
    indicating deletion upon termination, thereby creating a potential contradiction within the Agreement concerning
    data lifecycle management. The Parties acknowledge that the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably in
    this context, which may further complicate responsibilities related to processing activities and data subject rights
    enforcement.</p>
<p>In all processing activities, the Service Provider commits to applying appropriate security measures; however, the
    specific scope and nature of these measures are not exhaustively detailed herein, leaving some uncertainty about the
    extent of data protection afforded during processing. Any use of User Data beyond the expressly authorized purposes
    requires prior written consent from the Customer, safeguarding against unauthorized exploitation of the data.</p>

<h3>Retention and Deletion of Data</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall retain User Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
    Agreement or as required to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations. Upon termination of the
    contractual relationship, the Service Provider commits to deleting or returning User Data to the Customer without
    undue delay, except where retention is mandated by law or justified by legitimate backup and archival needs. It is
    acknowledged that the term “reasonable period” used herein in relation to data retention remains undefined, which
    may lead to differing interpretations between the Parties regarding the exact duration of such retention.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these deletion commitments, certain categories of User Data may be retained indefinitely for backup
    or compliance purposes, which arguably conflicts with earlier provisions that suggest prompt deletion upon
    termination. The Service Provider shall maintain appropriate safeguards to protect any retained data, though the
    specific measures and retention timelines are not exhaustively detailed within this Agreement, potentially creating
    ambiguity in enforcement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interchangeable use of “Customer” and “User” throughout this section could cause uncertainty
    concerning which party is responsible for initiating deletion requests or verifying the erasure of data. The
    Customer is responsible for providing clear instructions regarding data retention and deletion; however, the Service
    Provider may, at its sole discretion, interpret such instructions in a manner that prolongs data retention beyond
    what the Customer might expect. This ambiguity necessitates ongoing communication between the Parties to ensure
    alignment on data lifecycle management and compliance with data subject rights.</p>

<h2>Security Measures</h2>
<p>The Service Provider commits to implementing and maintaining appropriate technical and organizational measures
    designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk associated with the processing of User Data. These
    measures shall include, but are not limited to, encryption of data both at rest and in transit, regular
    vulnerability assessments, access controls restricting data processing to authorized personnel only, and the use of
    secure development lifecycle practices for the Tool_1 platform.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these commitments, the Agreement does not specify the exact standards or certifications the Service
    Provider adheres to, which might create ambiguity regarding the robustness and scope of the security framework in
    place. Furthermore, while the Service Provider undertakes to review and update security measures periodically, the
    frequency and criteria for such reviews remain undefined, potentially leading to interpretational discrepancies
    between the Parties.</p>
<p>Access to User Data is granted strictly on a need-to-know basis; however, the term “User” as used in this section may
    ambiguously refer to either the Customer’s internal Users or the Service Provider’s personnel, which could
    complicate accountability in the event of unauthorized access. The Customer shall promptly notify the Service
    Provider of any suspected or actual security incidents, and the Service Provider shall investigate and respond in
    accordance with its internal policies, although specific response timelines are not expressly detailed in this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Service Provider employs industry-standard backup and disaster recovery protocols to safeguard
    against data loss. Nevertheless, the retention of backup copies of User Data beyond termination of the Agreement, as
    mentioned in previous sections, may be at odds with the Customer’s expectation of data deletion, underscoring the
    need for clear, documented instructions regarding data retention and security obligations.</p>

<h3>Technical and Organizational Measures</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall implement and maintain comprehensive technical and organizational measures (“TOMs”) to
    protect User Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. These
    measures shall be proportionate to the risks presented by the processing activities and the nature of User Data
    involved. Included within these TOMs are access controls limiting data processing to authorized personnel,
    encryption of User Data both during transmission and at rest, regular security audits, and incident response
    protocols designed to detect and mitigate potential breaches promptly.</p>
<p>In addition, the Service Provider commits to ongoing employee training programs focusing on data protection
    principles and confidentiality obligations. Personnel with access to User Data are required to adhere to strict
    confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, when engaging subprocessors, the Service Provider shall ensure that
    equivalent technical and organizational safeguards are imposed and maintained, assuming full liability for any
    subprocessor non-compliance.</p>
<p>However, the Agreement does not specify the precise standards, such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2 certifications, that the
    Service Provider’s TOMs conform to, introducing ambiguity about the exact level of security assurance provided.
    Moreover, while periodic reviews of these measures are undertaken, the frequency and scope of such reviews are not
    explicitly defined herein, potentially leading to interpretational discrepancies between the Parties regarding
    adequacy and timeliness of security updates.</p>
<p>It is also noted that the term “User” in this section may ambiguously refer to either the Customer’s internal Users
    or the Service Provider’s own personnel, which could complicate understanding of access rights and responsibilities.
    The Parties acknowledge that despite the Service Provider’s commitment to enforce strict access controls, the
    interchangeable use of terminology throughout this Agreement may necessitate additional clarifications to ensure
    accountability and prevent unauthorized data exposure.</p>

<h3>Incident Response and Notification</h3>
<p>In the event of a personal data breach or any security incident impacting User Data, the Service Provider shall
    promptly notify the Customer without undue delay upon becoming aware of such an incident. Notification shall
    include, where feasible, a description of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data
    subjects affected, the categories and approximate volume of User Data concerned, as well as the likely consequences
    and measures taken or proposed to address the breach. However, the Agreement does not explicitly define the
    timeframe for “prompt” notification, which may lead to differing interpretations between the Parties regarding the
    urgency of communication.</p>
<p>The Customer shall be responsible for notifying relevant supervisory authorities and affected data subjects as
    required by applicable data protection laws, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Both Parties agree to cooperate
    fully in investigating the incident, mitigating its effects, and implementing corrective actions. The Service
    Provider shall provide reasonable assistance to the Customer in fulfilling its notification obligations, although
    the extent and nature of such assistance are not exhaustively detailed herein.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the term “User” used in this section may ambiguously refer to either the Customer’s
    organizational representatives or its end users, potentially complicating the identification of affected parties and
    responsibility for communication. Moreover, the Customer agrees to promptly inform the Service Provider of any
    incidents or suspected breaches detected within its own systems that could impact the Service Provider’s processing
    environment, though the definition of “promptly” remains unspecified, potentially causing delays in coordinated
    response efforts.</p>
<p>Both Parties commit to maintaining comprehensive records of all incidents and related communications for audit and
    compliance purposes. Despite these commitments, the Agreement does not clarify whether such records will be shared
    between the Parties or retained independently, which may result in inconsistent documentation practices. This
    ambiguity underscores the need for clear, documented procedures to be established in supplementary agreements or
    operational protocols to ensure effective incident management and regulatory compliance.</p>

<h3>Access Control and Encryption</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall implement stringent access control mechanisms to restrict access to User Data solely to
    authorized personnel who require such access to perform their designated functions under this Agreement. Access
    privileges will be granted based on the principles of least privilege and need-to-know, ensuring that users—whether
    internal Service Provider staff or subcontractors—are limited to data relevant to their roles. However, the
    Agreement does not explicitly distinguish between “Users” as Customer personnel and “Users” as Service Provider
    employees in the context of access controls, which may lead to interpretational ambiguities regarding
    accountability.</p>
<p>Authentication protocols, including multi-factor authentication where feasible, shall be employed to prevent
    unauthorized access. The Service Provider will maintain detailed access logs to monitor and audit data access
    activities, although the frequency and scope of such audits are not specifically delineated herein, potentially
    resulting in inconsistent enforcement.</p>
<p>Regarding encryption, the Service Provider commits to applying robust encryption standards to User Data both at rest
    and in transit. Data stored within Tool_1’s systems shall be encrypted using industry-recognized algorithms, and all
    data transmissions between the Customer, Users, and the Service Provider shall be secured through encrypted channels
    such as TLS. Notwithstanding these commitments, the Agreement lacks specificity on the exact encryption protocols or
    key management practices employed, which may create uncertainty for the Customer concerning the sufficiency of
    protections in place.</p>
<p>In the event of access control failures or encryption breaches, the Service Provider shall promptly initiate incident
    response procedures in accordance with the provisions set forth under "Incident Response and Notification." The
    Customer should be aware that while the Service Provider endeavors to prevent unauthorized access, residual risks
    may persist, particularly given the undefined parameters around access audits and encryption standards. Clearer
    delineation of roles and responsibilities concerning access control and encryption between the “User” and “Customer”
    entities would enhance mutual understanding and compliance assurance.</p>

<h2>Data Subject Rights</h2>
<p>In accordance with applicable data protection laws, the Service Provider agrees to assist the Customer in
    facilitating the exercise of data subject rights related to User Data processed within the scope of this Agreement.
    These rights include, but are not limited to, the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of
    processing, data portability, and objection to processing. The Customer, acting as the data controller, retains
    primary responsibility for receiving and managing requests from data subjects, who may be either the Customer’s
    organizational Users or end users, though the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” herein may lead
    to some ambiguity regarding the exact scope of these rights.</p>
<p>The Service Provider commits to responding to documented requests from the Customer relating to data subject rights
    within a reasonable timeframe; however, this timeframe is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, potentially
    resulting in differing expectations between the Parties. The Customer shall provide clear and unambiguous
    instructions to the Service Provider to enable timely and accurate fulfillment of such requests. Failure to do so
    may delay compliance and complicate accountability.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the Service Provider endeavors to comply fully with lawful data subject requests, certain
    limitations may apply where processing is necessary to fulfil legal obligations or for legitimate business
    interests, which may restrict or defer the exercise of some rights. It should be noted that the Service Provider may
    retain User Data for an undefined “reasonable period” beyond termination, which could conflict with erasure
    requests, thereby creating potential inconsistencies in the handling of data subject rights.</p>
<p>Both Parties agree to cooperate diligently to ensure compliance with data subject rights obligations and to document
    all actions taken in response to such requests. The Customer is responsible for informing its Users of their rights
    and the procedures for exercising them, while the Service Provider shall provide necessary support to uphold these
    rights within the limitations set forth in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Access Requests</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall assist the Customer in managing and responding to access requests made by data subjects
    concerning their User Data processed under this Agreement. Upon receipt of a valid access request from a data
    subject, the Customer shall promptly notify the Service Provider and provide all necessary information to enable the
    Service Provider to locate and retrieve the relevant data. The Service Provider agrees to facilitate access by
    compiling the requested information and delivering it to the Customer within a reasonable period. However, the
    Agreement does not explicitly define what constitutes a “reasonable period” for such responses, which may result in
    differing interpretations and potential delays.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Customer, acting as the data controller, to verify the identity of the requesting
    data subject and to ensure that the access request is legitimate. The Service Provider shall not be obligated to
    respond directly to data subjects unless otherwise instructed by the Customer. Furthermore, the interchangeable use
    of the terms “Customer” and “User” within this Agreement may create ambiguity regarding which party is responsible
    for initiating and managing access requests, particularly where the data subject is an end user rather than an
    organizational representative.</p>
<p>The Service Provider may impose reasonable measures to confirm the authenticity of access requests and may seek
    clarification from the Customer if the scope of the request is unclear or overly broad. Where legally permissible,
    the Service Provider reserves the right to deny access requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive; however,
    the criteria for such determinations are not detailed in this Agreement, potentially leading to inconsistent
    application.</p>
<p>In the event that the Service Provider receives a direct access request from a data subject, it shall promptly inform
    the Customer unless prohibited by law. Both Parties agree to cooperate fully to ensure that access requests are
    handled in a timely, secure, and compliant manner, notwithstanding the potential ambiguities introduced by
    inconsistent terminology and undefined response timelines within this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Rectification and Erasure</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall assist the Customer in rectifying any inaccurate or incomplete User Data upon receiving
    appropriate instructions from the Customer. The Customer is responsible for promptly notifying the Service Provider
    of any necessary corrections or updates to User Data to ensure accuracy and completeness throughout the data
    processing lifecycle. Notwithstanding this obligation, the Agreement does not specify the exact timeframe within
    which rectification must be completed, referring only to a “reasonable period,” which may lead to differing
    interpretations and potential delays in implementation.</p>
<p>Regarding erasure, the Service Provider commits to deleting or anonymizing User Data in accordance with documented
    instructions from the Customer, including in response to valid data subject erasure requests or upon termination of
    the Agreement. However, the Service Provider may retain certain User Data beyond such requests for legal compliance
    or backup purposes, potentially indefinitely, which may contradict earlier assurances concerning prompt deletion.
    This retention policy introduces some ambiguity as to whether erasure requests can be fully honored, especially when
    the Customer and User terms are used interchangeably and may not clearly delineate which party’s data is subject to
    deletion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Customer shall ensure that all erasure instructions are clear, specific, and unambiguous to avoid
    misinterpretation by the Service Provider. The Service Provider will confirm completion of erasure activities within
    a timeframe deemed reasonable, although this term is not explicitly defined herein. In cases where erasure cannot be
    fully effectuated due to overriding legal obligations, the Service Provider shall inform the Customer accordingly,
    but no detailed procedures for such notifications are provided in this Agreement, which may result in inconsistent
    communication practices.</p>
<p>Both Parties acknowledge that the inconsistent terminology throughout this Agreement, particularly the
    interchangeable use of “Customer” and “User,” may complicate the processes of rectification and erasure, and agree
    to address such ambiguities through supplemental documentation where necessary.</p>

<h3>Data Portability</h3>
<p>In accordance with applicable data protection laws, the Service Provider agrees to assist the Customer in
    facilitating data portability requests made by data subjects. This includes providing User Data in a structured,
    commonly used, and machine-readable format to enable the Customer or the data subject to transfer such data to
    another service provider without hindrance. The Customer, acting as the data controller, retains responsibility for
    initiating and managing data portability requests and for verifying the identity of the requesting data subject.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a valid data portability instruction from the Customer, the Service Provider shall endeavor to
    provide the requested data within a reasonable period; however, the specific timeframe for fulfilling such requests
    is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which may lead to differing expectations and potential delays. The
    Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or limit data portability activities if the request is deemed
    excessive or poses a security risk, though clear criteria for such determinations are not detailed herein.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the terms “Customer” and “User” are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement, and this
    ambiguity extends to the handling of data portability requests. Consequently, it may be unclear whether certain
    obligations pertain to organizational representatives within the Customer’s entity or to end users whose data is
    processed by the Service Provider. The Parties agree to clarify such responsibilities in additional documentation to
    ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Service Provider is not obligated to provide data portability for data that it has aggregated or
    anonymized, as such data falls outside the scope of personal data subject to portability rights. The Customer
    acknowledges that any transfer of User Data facilitated under this section shall comply with applicable legal
    requirements, including safeguards related to cross-border data transfers, notwithstanding the lack of explicit
    geographic restrictions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Objection to Processing</h3>
<p>Under applicable data protection laws, data subjects have the right to object to the processing of their User Data on
    grounds relating to their particular situation. The Service Provider agrees to assist the Customer in addressing
    such objections in a timely manner, provided that the Customer promptly notifies the Service Provider of the
    objection and provides clear, documented instructions on how to proceed. The Customer, acting as the data
    controller, retains ultimate responsibility for assessing the validity of the objection and for determining whether
    the processing may continue based on overriding legitimate grounds or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of
    legal claims.</p>
<p>The Service Provider shall suspend processing activities related to the objected User Data without undue delay upon
    receipt of a valid objection instruction from the Customer, unless otherwise required by applicable law. However,
    the term “undue delay” is not explicitly defined within this Agreement, which could result in varying
    interpretations of the response timeframe between the Parties. Furthermore, the Agreement’s inconsistent use of the
    terms “Customer” and “User” may cause ambiguity in identifying which party or individual is lodging the objection,
    particularly where objections originate from end users rather than organizational representatives.</p>
<p>Where the Service Provider identifies legal obligations or compelling legitimate interests that justify continuing
    processing despite the objection, it shall notify the Customer accordingly and provide relevant details to
    facilitate a joint determination. Notwithstanding this, the Agreement does not specify procedures for resolving
    disputes arising from conflicting interpretations of objections, potentially leading to delays or disagreements. The
    Customer acknowledges that the Service Provider may retain anonymized or aggregated data derived from the objected
    User Data for internal analytics purposes, even if the original data processing is suspended, which may appear
    inconsistent with the objector’s intent.</p>

<h2>Subprocessors</h2>
<p>The Service Provider may engage third-party subprocessors to assist in the provision of Tool_1’s services and the
    processing of User Data on behalf of the Customer. Such subprocessors may perform specific processing activities
    including, but not limited to, data hosting, maintenance, support services, and analytics enhancement. The Service
    Provider commits to ensuring that any subprocessor engaged complies with the terms of this Agreement and applicable
    data protection laws.</p>
<p>Prior to engaging a new subprocessor, the Service Provider shall notify the Customer of the intended subprocessor’s
    identity and the scope of processing activities to be performed. This notification shall be provided within a
    “reasonable period” before the subprocessor commences processing; however, this term is not explicitly defined
    herein, which may lead to differing expectations as to the timing and sufficiency of such notices. The Customer
    shall have the opportunity to object to the engagement of a subprocessor on reasonable grounds relating to data
    protection, provided that such objection is communicated within the unspecified “reasonable period.”</p>
<p>The Service Provider remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors and shall ensure that
    equivalent data protection obligations are imposed by way of written agreements with each subprocessor.
    Notwithstanding this, the Agreement does not expressly clarify whether the Service Provider’s liability extends to
    breaches caused by subcontractors engaged by the subprocessors, potentially creating ambiguity regarding
    accountability.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the term “User” within this section may ambiguously refer to either the Customer’s
    organizational Users or the Customer as a whole, which may complicate understanding of notification and consent
    requirements related to subprocessors. The Parties agree to address any such ambiguities through supplemental
    documentation or operational procedures to ensure compliance and clear responsibility allocation.</p>

<h3>Approval and Management of Subprocessors</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall obtain prior written approval from the Customer before engaging any new subprocessor to
    perform processing activities under this Agreement. Such approval requests shall include detailed information
    regarding the subprocessor’s identity, location, and the specific processing tasks to be delegated. The Customer
    shall review the information and communicate its approval or objection within a reasonable period; however, the term
    “reasonable period” remains undefined in this Agreement, potentially leading to differing interpretations regarding
    the timeframe for Customer response.</p>
<p>In the absence of a timely objection from the Customer, the subprocessor shall be deemed approved. Should the
    Customer object to the engagement of a proposed subprocessor, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to seek a
    mutually acceptable resolution. If no resolution is reached, the Service Provider reserves the right to either
    terminate the use of the subprocessor or suspend the relevant processing activities, notwithstanding any conflicting
    obligations under this Agreement or applicable law.</p>
<p>The Service Provider remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of all subprocessors, including any
    subcontractors retained by those subprocessors, although this liability is subject to the limitations set forth
    elsewhere in this Agreement. The Service Provider shall impose data protection obligations on subprocessors
    equivalent to those contained herein and shall monitor compliance accordingly.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the term “Customer” used in this section may sometimes be conflated with “User,” particularly
    where organizational Users may have roles in consent or objection processes, which may introduce ambiguity regarding
    who holds ultimate decision-making authority. The Parties agree to address any such ambiguity through supplemental
    agreements or operational procedures to ensure clarity and effective management of subprocessors.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities of Subprocessors</h3>
<p>Subprocessors engaged by the Service Provider shall adhere to the same data protection obligations and standards as
    set forth in this Agreement. They are required to process User Data solely based on documented instructions provided
    by the Service Provider, and by extension, in alignment with the Customer's requirements. Each subprocessor must
    implement adequate technical and organizational measures to protect User Data against unauthorized access, loss, or
    alteration, consistent with industry standards and applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>Prior to commencing any processing activities, subprocessors shall enter into written agreements with the Service
    Provider that impose data protection obligations equivalent to those contained in this Agreement. Such agreements
    shall also require subprocessors to cooperate with the Service Provider and Customer in fulfilling data subject
    rights and responding to data breaches or security incidents. Notwithstanding these requirements, the Agreement does
    not explicitly address the obligations of subprocessors in relation to downstream subcontractors, potentially
    leading to ambiguity concerning accountability in multi-tiered processing arrangements.</p>
<p>Subprocessors shall notify the Service Provider promptly of any incidents or breaches affecting User Data. The
    Service Provider, in turn, is responsible for informing the Customer without undue delay. However, the term
    “promptly” is not clearly defined, which may cause inconsistencies in incident reporting timelines. Additionally,
    the use of the term “User” within this section lacks clarity as to whether it refers to Customer end users,
    organizational representatives, or the subprocessors themselves, potentially complicating roles and
    responsibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, subprocessors are obligated to delete or return all User Data to the Service Provider upon completion or
    termination of their processing activities, unless retention is required by law. Despite this, certain subprocessors
    may retain User Data for backup or legal compliance purposes indefinitely, which may conflict with earlier
    provisions regarding data deletion and retention timelines. The Service Provider remains liable for ensuring
    subprocessors’ compliance with these provisions and shall take appropriate measures to address any deviations.</p>

<h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>The Service Provider may transfer User Data internationally to subprocessors, affiliates, or other third parties
    involved in the provision of Tool_1’s services. Such transfers may occur across jurisdictions with varying data
    protection laws and regulatory requirements. The Service Provider commits to ensuring that all international data
    transfers comply with applicable data protection legislation, including but not limited to the requirements under
    the GDPR for transfers outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>Where applicable, the Service Provider shall implement appropriate safeguards to protect User Data during
    cross-border transfers. These safeguards may include the use of standard contractual clauses approved by relevant
    supervisory authorities, binding corporate rules, or other legally recognized mechanisms. However, this Agreement
    does not explicitly specify which safeguards will be employed, potentially creating ambiguity for the Customer
    regarding the level of protection afforded to User Data during such transfers.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges and accepts that User Data may be processed and stored in countries that do not provide the
    same level of data protection as the Customer’s jurisdiction. The Service Provider shall notify the Customer of any
    material changes to the locations where User Data is transferred or processed, provided such notification is given
    within a reasonable timeframe, though this term is not clearly defined herein. This lack of specificity may lead to
    differing expectations regarding the timeliness and content of such notifications.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Provider shall remain liable for ensuring compliance with data protection
    obligations in relation to international transfers. The use of the term “User” in this section may ambiguously refer
    to either the Customer as a legal entity or the individual Users within the Customer’s organization, which could
    complicate accountability in the event of data transfer-related incidents or inquiries. The Parties agree to address
    any resulting ambiguities through supplementary documentation or operational protocols as necessary.</p>

<h3>Compliance with Transfer Mechanisms</h3>
<p>The Service Provider commits to ensuring that all international transfers of User Data are conducted in strict
    compliance with applicable data protection laws and recognized transfer mechanisms. Such mechanisms may include, but
    are not limited to, the use of standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or other legally approved
    frameworks designed to safeguard data when transferred outside the Customer’s jurisdiction. The Service Provider
    shall implement these measures to maintain an adequate level of protection consistent with the requirements of the
    GDPR and other relevant legislation.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these commitments, the Agreement does not explicitly specify the exact transfer mechanisms employed
    in each case, which may lead to ambiguity regarding the sufficiency and applicability of safeguards in particular
    jurisdictions. The Customer acknowledges that, while reasonable efforts will be made to ensure compliance, the
    Service Provider may rely on transfer mechanisms deemed adequate at its sole discretion, which could potentially
    diverge from the Customer’s expectations or internal policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the term “User” continues to be used interchangeably within this Agreement to refer both to the Customer
    entity and its organizational representatives, which might complicate defining the scope of responsibility in
    relation to transfer compliance. The Service Provider agrees to provide the Customer with documentation evidencing
    compliance with transfer mechanisms upon reasonable request; however, the timeframe and format for such disclosure
    are not expressly defined herein, potentially leading to differing interpretations of responsiveness.</p>
<p>In the event that the Service Provider becomes aware of any changes in the legal status of transfer mechanisms or
    receives guidance from supervisory authorities that affect the validity of current transfers, it shall notify the
    Customer promptly and cooperate in implementing any necessary remedial actions. The Parties acknowledge that due to
    the evolving nature of data protection laws, certain transfer arrangements may require renegotiation or amendment to
    this Agreement, which the Parties agree to address in good faith.</p>

<h3>Adequacy Decisions</h3>
<p>The Service Provider shall ensure that any international transfers of User Data to countries outside the Customer’s
    jurisdiction are conducted only where the European Commission or an equivalent competent authority has issued an
    adequacy decision recognizing the recipient country as providing an adequate level of data protection. In the
    absence of such an adequacy decision, the Service Provider commits to implementing appropriate safeguards in
    accordance with applicable data protection laws, as detailed in the section on International Data Transfers.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this commitment, the Agreement does not explicitly define the criteria or procedures by which the
    Service Provider will verify the continued validity of adequacy decisions or monitor changes in relevant legal
    frameworks. This lack of specificity may introduce ambiguity regarding the frequency and scope of such compliance
    checks. Furthermore, the term “User” as used in this context may ambiguously refer either to the Customer entity or
    to individual Users within the Customer’s organization, which could complicate responsibility for ensuring adherence
    to adequacy requirements.</p>
<p>In cases where adequacy decisions are withdrawn, suspended, or otherwise rendered invalid, the Service Provider shall
    promptly notify the Customer and collaborate on implementing alternative transfer mechanisms or necessary amendments
    to this Agreement. However, the timeframe within which such notifications and remedial actions must occur is not
    expressly defined, potentially leading to delays or differing interpretations of urgency.</p>
<p>The Customer acknowledges its responsibility to remain informed about relevant adequacy decisions applicable to its
    data transfers and to provide timely instructions to the Service Provider should changes in adequacy status
    necessitate adjustments to processing or transfer arrangements. Both Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to
    address any issues arising from changes in adequacy determinations, notwithstanding the occasional inconsistencies
    arising from the interchangeable use of “Customer” and “User” terminology throughout this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Standard Contractual Clauses</h3>
<p>To ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws governing international data transfers, particularly under
    the GDPR, the Parties agree that the processing and transfer of User Data shall be governed by the Standard
    Contractual Clauses ("SCCs") as adopted or approved by the relevant supervisory authority. These SCCs form an
    integral part of this Agreement and establish the obligations and rights of both the Service Provider and the
    Customer with respect to cross-border data flows.</p>
<p>The Service Provider commits to executing the SCCs in a manner consistent with the requirements set forth therein,
    including provisions on data subject rights, data security, and liability. Notwithstanding, the Agreement does not
    explicitly specify which version or module of the SCCs applies, potentially creating ambiguity regarding the scope
    and applicability of the clauses in different processing scenarios. The Parties acknowledge that this ambiguity may
    require clarification through supplemental agreements or written amendments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Customer recognizes that the term "User" as used in this section may ambiguously refer either to the
    Customer as a contracting entity or to individual Users within the Customer’s organization, which could complicate
    interpretation of certain SCC obligations, such as data subject redress mechanisms and notification duties. The
    Service Provider shall provide the Customer with reasonable assistance to comply with its obligations under the
    SCCs, although the precise nature and extent of such assistance are not exhaustively detailed herein.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the SCCs and this Agreement, the SCCs shall prevail solely to
    the extent necessary to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws. Both Parties agree to cooperate in
    good faith to resolve any inconsistencies and to update this Agreement as required to reflect changes in legal or
    regulatory frameworks affecting international data transfers.</p>

<h2>Audit and Compliance</h2>
<p>Both Parties acknowledge their mutual obligation to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable data protection laws
    and the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Service Provider shall maintain comprehensive records of its
    processing activities related to User Data and shall make these records available to the Customer upon reasonable
    request to facilitate audits or inspections. Such audits may be conducted by the Customer or an appointed third
    party, subject to providing the Service Provider with prior written notice within a reasonable timeframe, although
    the exact duration of this timeframe is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which may result in
    interpretational discrepancies.</p>
<p>The Customer agrees to conduct any audits in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Service Provider’s operations
    and respects confidentiality obligations. Conversely, the Service Provider shall cooperate fully with audit requests
    and provide all necessary information and documentation to demonstrate compliance with this Agreement and relevant
    legal requirements. However, the Agreement does not specify the scope or frequency of permissible audits,
    potentially leading to differing expectations between the Parties regarding audit rights and limitations.</p>
<p>It is further acknowledged that the Service Provider may rely on independent certifications or third-party audit
    reports to satisfy the Customer’s audit requirements, provided such documentation is current and relevant. The
    Parties agree that any findings arising from audits shall be addressed collaboratively and resolved in good faith
    within a mutually agreed timeframe. Notably, the interchangeable use of the terms “User” and “Customer” throughout
    this Agreement may create some ambiguity concerning which party is responsible for initiating audits or addressing
    compliance issues identified therein.</p>
<p>In the event of non-compliance or identified deficiencies, the Service Provider commits to implementing corrective
    actions promptly, though the Agreement does not define specific deadlines for remediation, potentially leading to
    delays in resolution. Both Parties agree to maintain open communication channels to monitor compliance effectively
    and to update this Agreement as necessary to reflect evolving regulatory standards and operational requirements.</p>

<h3>Audit Rights</h3>
<p>The Customer shall have the right to conduct audits of the Service Provider’s processing activities and compliance
    with the terms of this Agreement, subject to providing reasonable prior written notice. Such audits may be performed
    by the Customer itself or by a qualified third party appointed by the Customer, provided that any third party is
    bound by confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those set forth herein. The Service Provider agrees to
    cooperate fully with any audit requests and to provide timely access to relevant records, personnel, systems, and
    facilities necessary to verify compliance.</p>
<p>Audits shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Service
    Provider’s operations. The scope of audits shall be limited to the Service Provider’s obligations under this
    Agreement and applicable data protection laws. However, the Agreement does not clearly define the frequency or
    maximum duration of audits, which could lead to differing expectations between the Parties regarding the extent and
    intensity of audit activities.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to object to audit requests that it reasonably deems excessive or repetitive,
    though the criteria for such objections are not explicitly outlined in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
    Customer’s audit rights, the Service Provider may provide existing certifications or third-party audit reports in
    lieu of an on-site audit when deemed appropriate, thereby reducing potential operational impacts.</p>
<p>It is noted that the term “User” is occasionally used in this section without clear distinction whether it refers to
    the Customer as a contracting party or to individual Users within the Customer’s organization, which may cause
    ambiguity concerning who holds primary responsibility for initiating audit requests and managing compliance issues
    identified during audits. The Parties agree to clarify these roles and responsibilities in supplemental
    documentation to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Compliance Documentation</h3>
<p>Both Parties acknowledge the importance of maintaining comprehensive and accurate compliance documentation to
    demonstrate adherence to applicable data protection laws and the obligations set forth in this Agreement. The
    Service Provider shall maintain detailed records of processing activities, security measures, data breach incidents,
    and any subprocessor engagements relevant to the handling of User Data. These records shall be made available to the
    Customer upon reasonable request to facilitate audits, inspections, or regulatory inquiries.</p>
<p>The Customer is responsible for retaining documentation concerning consents, data subject rights requests, and any
    instructions provided to the Service Provider relating to data processing activities. While the Service Provider
    commits to providing reasonable assistance in compiling relevant compliance evidence, the Agreement does not
    explicitly define the format, scope, or frequency at which such documentation must be produced or updated, leading
    to potential ambiguity regarding the adequacy of recordkeeping practices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement may complicate the
    delineation of responsibilities for maintaining and sharing compliance documentation, particularly where data
    subject rights requests originate from individual Users within the Customer’s organization. The Parties agree to
    establish supplemental protocols to clarify these obligations and ensure that documentation is complete, accurate,
    and timely.</p>
<p>It is also noted that while the Service Provider shall endeavor to retain compliance records for a period consistent
    with legal requirements, the Agreement lacks specificity regarding the exact duration of such retention, which may
    result in differing interpretations and potential gaps in audit readiness. Both Parties commit to cooperating in
    good faith to address any compliance documentation deficiencies identified during audits or regulatory reviews,
    notwithstanding these ambiguities.</p>

<h3>Reporting Obligations</h3>
<p>Both Parties acknowledge their respective responsibilities to maintain transparent and timely communication regarding
    the processing of User Data under this Agreement. The Service Provider shall provide periodic reports to the
    Customer detailing relevant aspects of data processing activities, including but not limited to security incidents,
    data breaches, subprocessor engagements, and compliance with applicable data protection obligations. Such reports
    shall be delivered within intervals agreed upon by the Parties or, in the absence of explicit agreement, within a
    “reasonable period,” a term which remains undefined herein and may result in differing expectations.</p>
<p>The Service Provider commits to promptly inform the Customer of any material events that may impact the
    confidentiality, integrity, or availability of User Data. This includes, but is not limited to, incidents of
    unauthorized access or data loss, changes in subprocessor arrangements, or updates to security measures. The
    Customer shall similarly notify the Service Provider of any relevant changes to data processing instructions or
    regulatory requirements that may affect the Service Provider’s obligations.</p>
<p>While the Service Provider shall endeavor to provide comprehensive and accurate reporting, the Agreement does not
    specify the precise format, content, or delivery method for such reports, potentially creating ambiguity regarding
    the sufficiency of information exchanged. Furthermore, the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User”
    within this section may cause confusion about which party is responsible for certain notifications, particularly in
    cases where end users initiate data subject rights requests or report security concerns.</p>
<p>Both Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to define and refine reporting procedures as necessary to ensure
    effective oversight and compliance. Failure to provide timely reports or notifications may be considered a breach of
    this Agreement, though the consequences and remediation measures for such breaches are not expressly detailed
    herein. The Parties acknowledge that supplemental agreements or operational protocols may be required to clarify
    these obligations and resolve any ambiguities arising from inconsistent terminology or undefined timeframes.</p>

<h2>Termination and Consequences</h2>
<p>Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party, subject to any specific termination
    provisions stipulated in the overarching service contract governing the use of Tool_1. Termination may occur for
    convenience, breach of contractual obligations, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Upon termination, the
    Service Provider shall cease all processing of User Data unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>Following termination, the Service Provider agrees to delete or return all User Data to the Customer without undue
    delay, except where retention is mandated by legal, regulatory, or backup requirements. Notwithstanding this
    obligation, certain User Data may be retained by the Service Provider for an undefined “reasonable period” or
    indefinitely in accordance with backup and compliance protocols, which may conflict with earlier assurances of
    prompt data deletion and could cause uncertainty regarding the data lifecycle.</p>
<p>The Customer shall provide clear instructions regarding the preferred method of data return or deletion. In the
    absence of such instructions, the Service Provider reserves the right to determine the appropriate course of action,
    which may result in extended retention periods beyond Customer expectations. This ambiguity is further compounded by
    the inconsistent use of the terms “Customer” and “User” within this Agreement, potentially complicating the
    identification of the responsible party for initiating termination-related data handling procedures.</p>
<p>Termination shall not relieve either Party of obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination,
    including but not limited to confidentiality, indemnification, and liability provisions. Both Parties agree to
    cooperate in good faith to ensure an orderly transition and minimize disruption to Users or Customers relying on the
    Tool_1 platform. Any disputes arising from termination or its consequences shall be addressed pursuant to the
    dispute resolution mechanisms outlined elsewhere in the service agreement.</p>

<h3>Termination Conditions</h3>
<p>Either Party may terminate this Agreement subject to the conditions set forth herein, in addition to any termination
    rights specified in the primary service contract governing the use of Tool_1. Termination may be effected for cause,
    including but not limited to material breach by the other Party, insolvency, or failure to comply with applicable
    data protection laws. Additionally, termination for convenience is permitted by either Party upon providing written
    notice within a reasonable timeframe, although this term is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, which may lead
    to uncertainty regarding the required notice period.</p>
<p>The Customer or User shall provide documented notice specifying the grounds for termination when invoking cause,
    including sufficient detail to substantiate the claim. The Service Provider shall have a cure period to remedy any
    alleged breach, which shall be deemed a “reasonable period” as determined solely by the Service Provider, an
    ambiguity that may result in differing expectations between the Parties.</p>
<p>Upon termination, the Service Provider shall suspend processing activities related to the Customer’s data and
    initiate data return or deletion procedures as instructed. However, as noted elsewhere in this Agreement, certain
    User Data may be retained for undefined durations due to backup or legal obligations, creating a potential conflict
    with the expectation of immediate data erasure upon termination. Furthermore, the interchangeable use of “Customer”
    and “User” within this section may cause confusion regarding which party is responsible for initiating termination
    notices and instructing on data disposition.</p>
<p>Termination shall not affect accrued rights or liabilities and shall be without prejudice to any remedies available
    under applicable law. Both Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to ensure a seamless transition and mitigate any
    adverse impact on Users, Customers, or other stakeholders relying on the Tool_1 platform.</p>

<h3>Data Return or Deletion</h3>
<p>Upon termination of this Agreement, the Service Provider shall, at the Customer’s direction, either return all User
    Data processed under this Agreement or securely delete such data without undue delay. The method and timing of data
    return or deletion shall be mutually agreed upon in writing; however, in the absence of explicit instructions from
    the Customer, the Service Provider reserves the right to determine the appropriate course of action, which may
    include extended retention for backup or legal compliance purposes. This discretion may lead to interpretations that
    diverge from the Customer’s expectations regarding prompt data erasure.</p>
<p>Data returned to the Customer shall be provided in a commonly used, machine-readable format to facilitate continued
    use or archival by the Customer. If deletion is requested, the Service Provider commits to irreversibly removing
    User Data from all active systems and backups within a timeframe deemed reasonable by the Service Provider, though
    this term is not explicitly defined in this Agreement, potentially causing uncertainty regarding the duration of
    retention.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that certain data may be exempt from deletion or return due to overriding legal or regulatory
    retention obligations. In such cases, the Service Provider shall inform the Customer of the categories of data
    retained and the applicable retention periods. Notwithstanding earlier provisions promising deletion upon
    termination, this retention may extend indefinitely, which constitutes a potential contradiction within the
    Agreement.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, the Service Provider shall maintain appropriate security measures to protect User Data from
    unauthorized access or disclosure. The Customer, or where applicable the User, shall bear responsibility for
    providing clear and unambiguous instructions concerning data disposition. The interchangeable use of the terms
    “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement may complicate the identification of the party responsible for
    initiating and verifying completion of data return or deletion, necessitating further clarification in supplemental
    documentation.</p>

<h3>Survival of Obligations</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Parties agree that all obligations and
    provisions herein which by their nature are intended to survive such termination shall remain in full force and
    effect. This includes, but is not limited to, obligations concerning the confidentiality, security, and protection
    of User Data, as well as the responsibilities related to data retention, deletion, and incident notification. The
    Service Provider’s commitment to safeguard User Data shall continue beyond the termination date for a period deemed
    reasonable to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, although the definition of “reasonable”
    remains unspecified within this Agreement, potentially leading to differing interpretations between the Parties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, obligations relating to data subject rights, audit and compliance, and liability shall also survive
    termination to the extent necessary to address any outstanding issues arising from the processing activities
    conducted prior to the cessation of services. The Customer acknowledges that certain User Data may be retained by
    the Service Provider beyond termination for indefinite durations pursuant to backup or legal retention policies,
    which may appear inconsistent with earlier assurances of prompt data deletion and could create ambiguity about the
    duration and scope of post-termination data handling.</p>
<p>It is also noted that the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement persists
    in this section, which may complicate the identification of the party responsible for fulfilling ongoing obligations
    after termination. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to clarify and resolve any such ambiguities through
    supplemental documentation or operational protocols, ensuring that all surviving obligations are effectively managed
    and enforced.</p>

<h2>General Provisions</h2>
<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties concerning the subject matter herein and
    supersedes all prior agreements, communications, and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the
    processing of User Data through the Tool_1 platform. Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement shall be
    valid only if made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Informal communications or
    changes conveyed via email or other non-executed documents shall not be deemed effective unless explicitly confirmed
    in writing.</p>
<p>Neither Party may assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
    of the other Party, except that the Service Provider may assign this Agreement to an affiliate or a successor entity
    in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, provided that the assignee assumes all obligations
    herein. The Customer’s failure to provide timely consent to such assignment shall not unreasonably withhold or delay
    the Service Provider’s ability to effectuate such a transfer.</p>
<p>Should any provision of this Agreement be found invalid or unenforceable by a competent authority, the remaining
    provisions shall continue in full force and effect, and the Parties shall endeavor to replace the invalid provision
    with a valid one that most closely reflects the original intent. The headings used in this Agreement are for
    convenience only and shall not affect interpretation.</p>
<p>In the event of conflict between this Agreement and any other contractual documents governing the use of Tool_1, the
    provisions herein shall prevail solely to the extent necessary to address data processing obligations. It is
    acknowledged that the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement may lead to
    ambiguities in interpretation and enforcement. The Parties commit to resolving any such ambiguities in good faith
    and may refer to supplemental documentation to clarify roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>All notices under this Agreement shall be delivered in writing and sent via email or certified mail to the contact
    details provided by each Party. Notices shall be deemed received on the date of delivery if sent by email during
    business hours, or on the next business day if sent outside such hours. The term “reasonable period” used in this
    section and elsewhere in the Agreement is not explicitly defined, potentially leading to differing interpretations
    regarding response times and notice periods.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in the
    overarching service contract between the Parties, without regard to its conflict of law principles. In the absence
    of an explicitly designated jurisdiction in the primary contract, the laws of the Service Provider’s principal place
    of business shall apply. Notwithstanding this, the Customer may invoke applicable mandatory data protection
    regulations that supersede local laws where relevant. This dual application of governing laws may introduce
    ambiguity regarding which legal framework predominates in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p>Both Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located within the agreed jurisdiction as
    specified in the primary service agreement for the resolution of any disputes arising under or in connection with
    this Agreement. However, if no such forum is designated, either Party may seek recourse in any competent court with
    appropriate jurisdiction, which could lead to conflicting forum selections and procedural uncertainties.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement may
    complicate the identification of the proper party subject to legal obligations or enforcement actions under the
    governing law. The Parties agree to cooperate in clarifying such ambiguities through supplemental documentation if
    necessary to ensure consistent application of the governing law provisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Parties agree that any arbitration or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms referenced in the
    primary service contract shall also apply to disputes under this Agreement, unless explicitly excluded. The absence
    of direct reference to such mechanisms within this Agreement itself may cause interpretative inconsistencies
    regarding dispute resolution processes.</p>

<h3>Liability and Indemnification</h3>
<p>Each Party shall be liable for any damages or losses arising from its breach of this Agreement, including violations
    of applicable data protection laws, negligence, or willful misconduct. The Service Provider’s total liability for
    direct damages related to the processing of User Data shall be limited to the amount paid by the Customer under the
    primary service contract during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. Notwithstanding this limitation, neither
    Party shall be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data,
    or business opportunities, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>The Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Service Provider and its affiliates, officers, and
    employees against any claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses arising from the Customer’s breach of this
    Agreement, including failure to obtain requisite consents for data processing or instructions that result in
    unlawful processing of User Data. Conversely, the Service Provider agrees to indemnify the Customer against claims
    arising from the Service Provider’s negligent or unlawful processing of User Data in violation of this
    Agreement.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” within this Agreement may create
    ambiguity regarding the identification of the indemnifying party and the scope of indemnification obligations,
    particularly where claims originate from individual Users as opposed to the Customer entity. Furthermore, the
    Service Provider’s indemnification obligations do not extend to damages resulting from modifications of the Tool_1
    platform made unilaterally by the Customer or its Users, which may lead to interpretative discrepancies concerning
    responsibility for platform-related issues.</p>
<p>Both Parties agree to promptly notify each other in writing of any claim or demand for which indemnification may be
    sought and to cooperate fully in the defense or settlement thereof. The indemnified Party shall have the right to
    participate in such defense with counsel of its choosing at its own expense. This section does not limit any other
    legal remedies available to either Party under applicable law or this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Amendments to the Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument duly executed by authorized representatives of
    both Parties. Any such amendments shall explicitly reference this Agreement and specify the provisions to be
    altered, added, or removed. Informal communications, including email exchanges or verbal agreements, shall not
    constitute valid amendments unless subsequently formalized in writing and signed by both Parties.</p>
<p>The Service Provider reserves the right to propose amendments to address changes in applicable data protection laws,
    regulatory requirements, or operational practices related to the processing of User Data. In such cases, the Service
    Provider shall provide the Customer with written notice of the proposed amendments within a reasonable period prior
    to their intended effective date. The term “reasonable period” remains undefined within this Agreement, potentially
    leading to differing interpretations concerning the timing and adequacy of such notifications.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a proposed amendment, the Customer shall review and respond in writing within a reasonable timeframe,
    either consenting to or objecting to the changes. Failure to respond within said timeframe shall be deemed
    acceptance of the amendment, unless otherwise agreed. However, this deemed acceptance provision may conflict with
    other sections herein requiring explicit Customer consent for modifications affecting data processing, thereby
    introducing potential inconsistencies regarding the validity of amendments.</p>
<p>Moreover, the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement may cause ambiguity in
    identifying the party responsible for reviewing, approving, or rejecting proposed amendments, particularly where
    amendments impact processing activities involving individual Users rather than the Customer as a legal entity. The
    Parties agree to clarify such responsibilities through supplemental documentation or operational protocols to ensure
    effective management of Agreement modifications.</p>
<p>All amendments shall become effective on the date mutually agreed upon by the Parties or, in the absence of such
    agreement, on the date specified in the written amendment. Until such time, the existing terms of this Agreement
    shall remain in full force and effect. Any amendments that conflict with mandatory provisions of applicable data
    protection laws shall be deemed unenforceable to the extent of such conflict, without affecting the validity of the
    remaining provisions.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>This Agreement, including all annexes, schedules, and any referenced documents, constitutes the entire understanding
    and agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior negotiations,
    representations, or agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the processing of User Data through the Tool_1
    platform. No other agreements, communications, or understandings, whether expressed or implied, shall be deemed to
    bind either Party unless expressly incorporated by written amendment signed by authorized representatives of both
    the Service Provider and the Customer.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, any pre-existing agreements between the Parties that address other aspects of the
    provision or use of Tool_1’s services shall remain in force to the extent they do not conflict with the terms of
    this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this Agreement and any other contractual
    document, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail solely with respect to data processing obligations, unless
    explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the interchangeable use of the terms “Customer” and “User” throughout this Agreement may
    introduce ambiguity regarding which entity or individual is bound by certain provisions or entitled to specific
    rights. The Parties agree that in cases of uncertainty, the context of the relevant provision shall guide
    interpretation, but such ambiguity may necessitate further clarification through supplementary documentation or
    operational protocols to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any amendments or modifications to this Agreement shall be valid only if made in writing and signed by
    duly authorized representatives of both Parties. Informal communications, including email exchanges or verbal
    discussions, shall not constitute valid modifications. The Service Provider’s prior communications referencing
    “reasonable periods” or other undefined terms shall not be construed as altering the terms of this Agreement unless
    expressly confirmed in writing.</p>
