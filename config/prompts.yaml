tool_name_generation:
  system: |
    You are a creative software product naming assistant.
    Generate realistic, professional software tool names that sound like real SaaS products.
    Names should be:
    - 1-3 words
    - Professional and memorable
    - Related to the tool's category and purpose
    - Avoid generic names like "Tool 1" or "App X"
    
    Examples of good names:
    - DataVault Pro
    - ComplianceHub
    - SecureFlow Analytics
    - CloudSync Manager
      
    user_template: |
      Generate a unique, professional software tool name for:
      Category: {category}
      User Base: {user_base}
    
      Return ONLY the tool name, nothing else.

tool_info_generation:
  system: |
    You are an assistant that generates fictional software tool descriptions. 
    Return ONLY JSON with keys: name, purpose, category, user_base.
  user_template: |
    Generate a fictional software tool with name {name}, category {category}, and user base {user_base}

toc_generation:
  system: |
    You are a document architect. Produce ONLY a JSON object (no extra commentary).
    The JSON must match the agreed TOC schema: a top-level "title" and a "sections" array.
    Sections may contain nested "subsections" to represent deeper structure.
  user_template: |
    Tool info: {tool_info_json}
    Document type: {document_type}
    Please generate a realistic, nested TOC for this document type.
    Aim for 4–10 top-level sections; some may have subsections (depth up to 3).
    Use clear legal/compliance style section titles appropriate to enterprise software.
    Return JSON only (no surrounding markdown or explanation).

section_generation:
  system: |
    You are a legal document writer generating enterprise software documentation.

    Rules:
      - Output MUST be valid HTML
      - Do NOT include <html>, <head>, or <body>
      - Use semantic HTML (h2, h3, p, ul, li)
      - Write realistic, detailed legal text
      - IMPORTANT: Each document must intentionally include 2-3 data quality issues:
        * Contradictory or conflicting clauses (e.g., saying data is deleted in one place but retained in another)
        * Ambiguous or vague language (e.g., "reasonable period" without definition)
        * Minor typos or formatting errors (e.g., "teh" instead of "the", missing punctuation)
        * Inconsistent terminology or cross-references (e.g., referring to "User" in one section and "Customer" in another without clarification)
      - Distribute these issues naturally throughout the document, not all in one section
      - Make the issues subtle enough to seem like real document flaws

  user_template: |
    Tool info: {tool_info_json}
    
    Document type: {document_type}
    
    Previously generated sections (HTML): {previous_html}
    
    Now generate the next section titled: "{section_title}"
    
    Requirements:
    - Start with a "{heading_tag}" HTML heading tag
    - Length: 150–300 words (realistic length for enterprise legal documents)
    - Sound like a real enterprise legal document
    - Include at least one of the required data quality issues (contradictions, ambiguity, typos, or inconsistent terminology) in this section if appropriate
    - Maintain coherence with previously generated sections
