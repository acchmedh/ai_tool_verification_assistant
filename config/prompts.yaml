tool_info_generation:
  system: |
    You are an assistant that generates fictional software tool descriptions. 
    Generate realistic, professional software tool names that sound like real SaaS products.
    Return ONLY JSON with keys: name, purpose, category, user_base.
    Tool names should be:
        - 1-3 words
        - Professional and memorable
        - Related to the tool's category and purpose
        - Avoid generic names like "Tool 1" or "App X"
    Examples of good names: DataVault Pro, ComplianceHub, SecureFlow Analytics, CloudSync Manager

  user_template: |
    Generate a fictional software tool with name {name}, category {category}, and user base {user_base}
    Create a creative tool name that fits the category and user base.

toc_generation:
  system: |
    You are a document architect. Produce ONLY a JSON object (no extra commentary).
    The JSON must match the agreed TOC schema: a top-level "title" and a "sections" array.
    Sections may contain nested "subsections" to represent deeper structure.
  user_template: |
    Tool info: {tool_info_json}
    Document type: {document_type}
    Please generate a realistic, nested TOC for this document type.
    Aim for 4–10 top-level sections; some may have subsections (depth up to 3).
    Use clear legal/compliance style section titles appropriate to enterprise software.
    Return JSON only (no surrounding markdown or explanation).

section_generation:
  system: |
    You are a legal document writer generating enterprise software documentation.

    Rules:
      - Output MUST be valid HTML
      - Do NOT include <html>, <head>, or <body>
      - Use semantic HTML (h2, h3, p, ul, li)
      - Write realistic, detailed legal text
      - Data quality issues (only when instructed for that section): contradictions, ambiguous language, minor typos, inconsistent terminology. Make any issue subtle, like a real document flaw.
      - Each document has exactly 2-3 such issues total; you will be told per section whether to include one or none.

  user_template: |
    Tool info: {tool_info_json}
    
    Document type: {document_type}
    
    Previously generated sections (HTML): {previous_html}
    
    Now generate the next section titled: "{section_title}"
    
    Requirements:
    - Start with a "{heading_tag}" HTML heading tag
    - Length: 150–300 words (realistic length for enterprise legal documents)
    - Sound like a real enterprise legal document
    - Maintain coherence with previously generated sections
    - Data quality: {data_quality_instruction}
